大多数时候，我们做的事情在外界观察者眼中完全不合常理。脱离具体情境来看，这些行为简直荒谬至极。但对于身处这片混沌——这场活动旋风中心的人们而言，其中自有一种规律性、可预测性和特定动机。这就是道。 道即行事之法，是某种特定的实践方式或风格。开源社区管理的实践就像一种难以理解的疯狂形式，尤其对那些不熟悉开源软件开发流程的人，或是那些突然需要协调他人共同参与开发的人而言。本指南旨在揭示这种不断演进的方法论与实践形式，其核心只有一个简单问题：你倾向于以何种方式实践开源之道？ 但更深层次而言，这项工作真正探讨的是：人们为何要以这种方式开展工作？为何要用这种或那种方法来组织这场\"疯狂\"？ 因此从这个引言中，你应该把握两个要点： 要成功且可持续地创建和维护开源软件，必须明确\"做什么\"、\"怎么做\"以及\"为什么做\"这三个核心问题。 本指南汇集了大量开源实践者的观点，这些人经常需要回答\"我们为何以这种方式开展开源工作\"这类问题。 特别说明，本指南是一份动态文档，致力于汇集并传播多元声音——这些声音同样（且带有一定主观性地）在探索创建和管理开源软件社区的最佳方式。

例如 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 就位于许多构成它的开源软件项目\"下游\"，比如 Fedora 和 CentOS Stream。而这些项目本身又依赖于更多\"上游\"项目——比如 Linux 内核、GNOME 桌面环境以及数百个其他项目。","breadcrumbs":"马上开始 » 社区入门指南 »

这些对话还会带来另一个副产品：对于那些可能曾将你的软件视为无名企业产品的用户来说，你正在为项目赋予姓名和面孔。简而言之，你正在建立一种关系。 试想初到新学校、新社区或新公司时的情景。让你产生归属感的，正是与几分钟前还是陌生人的那种 人际联结 。这种关系虽微小且初生，却能让对方重返你的项目，从使用者转变为社区参与者。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加 » 从用户到贡献者 »

造成这种犹豫的常见原因包括：对英语写作能力缺乏信心、自认为技术水平不足、对公开同行评审感到紧张，以及将社区互动视为\"沟通\"或\"营销\"——他们认为这不属于本职工作范畴。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加 » 从用户到贡献者 » 帮助开发者参与社区项目","id":"101","title":"帮助开发者参与社区项目"},"102":{"body":"传统上，大学工程类课程并不十分重视清晰的书面沟通能力培养。这可能导致专业软件开发人员缺乏写作技能锻炼。而在开源项目中，书面交流对于与社区团队进行异步协作至关重要：无论是通过博客宣传工作成果、编写功能提案文档，还是在邮件列表中讨论路线图项目的利弊。 此外，虽然大多数工程师都推崇逻辑严谨，但修辞学和辩论技巧通常不属于工程学课程范畴。最终结果是，当需要撰写工作报告或在公共论坛提问时，他们往往会犹豫不决。 对于非英语母语者而言，英语水平不足导致的信心缺失也可能成为阻碍邮件列表参与的障碍。 我记得曾共事过一位工程师，他对撰写我们讨论过的问题邮件显得十分犹豫，即便我们都认为有必要与社区进行探讨。当他终于动笔时，他似乎又对社区成员的回复或质疑置若罔闻。后来与他谈及此事，才发现他对于在公开存档的邮件列表中进行书面讨论感到不适——他担心任何失当之举或礼节疏忽都会遭到社区的严厉指摘。 解决这个问题的最佳方式是循序渐进。 一个很好的开端是让工程师们参与解答问题。有效的方法是在邮件列表中公开将问题转给某位工程师，同时肯定他们在该领域的专长。\"Tammy 对 RLE 算法了如指掌。Tammy，能否请你回答 Franz 的问题？\" 这有点像绝地武士的心理技巧，能达成三个目的。首先，当问题面向群体时，个人很容易忽略，但直接向某人提问时很少有人会不回答——这是人性使然。 其次，肯定工程师的技能可以强化他们在相关领域被视为专家的认知，从而增强他们回答问题的信心。第三，通过明确指定具备特定技能的个人工程师，你让外部人士得以窥见公司内部的情况。你让团队显得人性化——这是一群各有所长、各有所短的个体，而非面目模糊的\"Acme 公司开发组\"整体。 另一件值得做的事是让开发者养成定期写作的习惯。仅仅站在一旁要求每个人都开博客是不够的。如果写作令人畏惧，那么更频繁地练习会让它变得不那么可怕。实现这一点有很多方法——奖励博客文章、要求定期提交状态报告、在关闭工单时撰写更详细的提交信息或评论，或是安排时间举办创意写作研讨会。目标不是把开发者变成小说家，而是让你的团队养成写作的习惯。 最后，你应该对工程师进行基本的网络礼仪和邮件写作培训。开发者对待写邮件应该像对待代码补丁一样认真。当你生成一个补丁时，通常在发送前最后一步是检查它，确保没有包含任何愚蠢的错误。将同样的习惯应用到邮件中，就能发现措辞不当或模糊的地方，从而写出更好的邮件。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加 » 从用户到贡献者 » 缺乏信心","id":"102","title":"缺乏信心"},"103":{"body":"对于许多软件工程师来说，写作本身已令人望而生畏，而将自己的作品交给一群不太熟悉的人进行同行评审更是令人紧张不已。 根据我的经验，系统性同行评审在软件行业并非惯例。部分管理者将同行评审视为额外负担——毕竟开发者是因胜任工作才被聘用，没人喜欢被\"社区\"反复质疑。当工程师积累到一定经验后，同行评审对我们行业的专业软件开发人员而言，更像是例外而非常态。 在社区项目中，同行评审是常规要求。事实上，这是区分成功社区项目与普通项目的关键最佳实践之一。社区开发者期望在功能开发前就能参与讨论，并有机会提出更优的实现方案。他们要求新贡献者提交可供审查的补丁——这是新人获得提交者或维护者身份前建立信任的必经之路。 让专业软件团队成员适应同行评审的最佳方式，是制定公司规定禁止\"首日提交权限\"——即禁止员工入职当天就获得开源项目代码库提交权限的做法。对于企业赞助的项目，新开发人员提交的代码应当与外部贡献者一样经过完整的评审流程。 对于企业参与社区项目的贡献，这意味着要避免内部分支和\"守门人\"式的项目结构——即由一两名开发人员负责提交团队其他成员的工作成果。 开发者在向内部提交代码的同时，也应将工作成果提交至上游社区。对于那些仅适用于内部分支的变更，仍需在私有代码库中进行同行评审。随着基于 git 的代码库成为软件开发新常态，这对企业而言已不像过去那样具有挑战性，但让团队顺利转型为成功的社区贡献者仍是必要之举。 让新晋开发者经历这段评审期具有重要意义——最重要的是这能证明企业员工与非员工贡献者同样需要经过项目验证，同时也为新员工提供了熟悉项目编码规范、沟通惯例的适应期，并在此期间向整个社区进行自我介绍。这一过程对于资深社区开发者指导新人而言至关重要。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加 » 从用户到贡献者 »

如果开发者将\"给邮件列表发邮件\"框定为\"发布公告\"，这在他们脑海中就被归入\"市场宣传\"范畴。曾有开发者告诉我，她没时间给邮件列表发邮件，因为还有\"真正的工作\"要做。在她看来，\"处理社区事务\"是我作为社区管理者的职责。她认为社区信息传递属于支持性工作，并非其本职范畴。 《Cluetrain 宣言》的作者们提出，在当今互联互通的世界里，营销部门已不复存在——公司员工与外部人员的每次互动，都是赢得或丧失声誉的机会。 在自由软件开发团队中，这一点尤为显著。项目传播没有专门的营销部门。要想高效工作，就必须与同行交流，因此对于从事社区项目的人员而言，对外沟通的制度性障碍必须消除。 即使在那些对开源沟通有明确期望的组织中，工程师们也可能会自我设限。他们可能会花上数小时打磨提案后才提交。这在社区项目中适得其反，因为初始提案越是精致，投入的情感成本就越高。精雕细琢的提案也更难被评审和修改，因为它们看起来已经完成了。更好的做法是发布粗糙的早期草案，让作者有机会整合早期反馈。 向团队证明\"早发布、常发布\"优势的最佳方式是以身作则。作为团队负责人或管理者，你可以通过尽早公开团队计划并频繁迭代来引领示范。实施时，要向团队明确指出由此带来的益处。打破这种心理障碍需要时间，但通过明确表示不追求完美、奖励早期信息发布并鼓励反馈，你的团队很快会意识到外部参与者是协作伙伴，而非观众。 另一个有用的技巧是要求工程师将任务分解为更小的部分，这样即使他们坚持等到第一部分达到高标准，信息也能更快地传播出去，从而让反馈可以指导后续阶段的工作。 阻碍早期沟通目标实现的是人们普遍渴望的\"重磅发布\"心态。企业往往希望将产品发布和公告与大型贸易展会同步。这可能导致公司要求工程师在内部秘密开发重要功能，唯恐提前曝光会破坏惊喜效果。另一种做法是在项目启动时就宣布，而非等到有成果展示时——但这会导致产品上市前经历漫长等待，引发主流媒体的不耐烦和负面报道。 可以将工程师讨论重大功能的设计决策和实现细节的邮件列表，与通过新闻稿和营销活动来宣传公告区分开来。这样当最终公告发布时，社区不会感到完全意外，你也不必为自己数月来秘密工作、突然提交大量难以审查的代码而被迫辩解。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加 » 从用户到贡献者 »

资金支持（在可行且受欢迎的情况下）。（对于许多开源项目而言，这并非总是容易甚至可行的贡献方式。） 担任论坛版主。 在活动中提供协助 担任版本版本经理 一份网站设计。 一个自动化脚本。 一套测试用例集。 测试和错误报告。 建立两个项目间的合作关系 撰写营销方案 制定路线图 在社区项目中施展项目管理(PM)技能 进行定量或定性分析。 设计一个标志。 制定项目行为准则 为项目提供法律方面的支持。 建立贡献者/维护者/领导者的招募流程。 诸如此类。 从客户服务到产品管理，几乎所有你在工作岗位上可能学到的技能，都能成为贡献的基础。 任何你能想到其他社区可能存在的需求，都可能成为开源社区的需求，并构成贡献的基础。 关注贡献类型的广度和深度是很有益的。 作为社区管理实践的一部分，你必须意识到人们参与项目的多种方式。

例如，当你开始一个新职位（或加入一个全新组织）时，你需要熟悉新同事、新工具、新流程、新规范、新规定等等。你往往会迫切希望快速完成这些适应过程，因为你渴望向组织证明自己的价值，并在这个新环境中感到自在，从而发挥最佳工作状态。你越早感受到自己正在产生影响，就越可能长期留在这个社区，同时也会获得更高的满意度。 但你也可能加入一个拥有深厚历史的团队——这里存在着共同的规范习俗、内部笑话、专业术语、心照不宣的约定、紧密纽带以及集体认同感。简而言之，你的新团队或组织在你加入前就已形成独特的文化。这种文化虽然大多是无形的，但会深刻影响你与他人的协作能力。有效的入门引导能帮助你理解这种文化。 开源社区的入门体验同样面临这些挑战。具体而言，开源社区的入门存在以下难点： 异步远程的工作环境 传统办公环境的最大优势在于，你能与同事和管理者面对面交流，随时快速请教问题。而加入新的开源社区时，你往往需要与身处不同地域、时区的成员协作。因此，除非社区提供完善的入门材料——包括文档、视频教程、维基页面等资源——否则即便是经验丰富的自主学习者，在开源社区起步也会面临更大挑战。 冒充者综合征 当难以获得实时帮助或反馈时，人们很容易因简单的工具问题而陷入困境，并对自己的工作失去信心。因此，开源社区中良好的入门体验对于新成员至关重要，能避免他们在社区初期就感到气馁。 显著差异性 每个开源社区都独一无二。即便是经验丰富的开源贡献者，加入新社区时也需要熟悉新的工具、流程甚至术语。在不同社区中，看似简单的词汇如\"贡献\"、\"社区成员\"、\"项目\"、\"上游\"等可能具有细微差异，极易引发新成员的困惑。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加 » 构建新用户引导体验 »

回答关于项目入门流程的第一个问题需要做大量工作。潜在贡献者需要了解自己能提供哪些最有价值的贡献。许多项目在源代码库中设置了\"首次贡献者\"之类的标签，这是引导新人为项目解决问题和漏洞的绝佳方式，同时也能帮助新人熟悉项目的原始资料。 第二个问题——\"在哪里贡献\"——出人意料的是，项目组提出这个问题的频率并不高。项目老手可能会轻描淡写地说：\"论坛上都有\"或\"详情看维基\"。但这些资料具体存放在哪个代码库？属于哪个组织？那些名称相似的其他项目又该如何区分？请确保项目网站上清晰地展示新人可以产生影响的具体链接。这些链接也不应被深藏，最好能直接显示在主页上。 第三个问题是“如何贡献”。很多时候，项目方发布了源代码，顶多让其易于被发现……然后就止步于此。你可能听别人把这种做法称为“抛过墙”（throw it over the wall），而这可不是什么好话。太多项目将代码或内容推送到公共空间，宣称向所有人开放，随后却纳闷贡献者都去哪儿了。这可能是因为确实存在准入门槛——缺乏如何向项目贡献的文档和流程说明。

这听起来或许显而易见，但新人融入的另一关键资源是社区其他成员。即便大家不在同一办公室工作，让新成员能接触到经验丰富的社区成员来答疑解惑，也能有效缓解初期可能产生的孤立感。对于规模较小、相对新兴的社区，简单的\"迎新伙伴\"制度——比如安排欢迎电话沟通——可能就已足够。而在规模更大、更成熟的社区中，人们可能会看到专门负责新人引导的工作组，甚至设有教练或指导者等正式头衔的社区成员。 当人员配备到位后，这些信息（特别是关于联系谁寻求帮助的内容）需要发布在多个地方，让人们感到可以放心联系他们的入职资源，并受到鼓励提出问题。如果获得帮助很困难，新人会感到气馁，不愿参与社区活动，甚至可能认为这个社区终究不适合他们。 无论是入职伙伴、指导者还是工作组，都需要确保志愿者队伍足够庞大，以免他们在引导新人时感到力不从心——这在社区发展壮大时尤为重要。关键在于营造一种社区文化，让每位成员都意识到自己有责任欢迎新成员。理想状态下，我们希望看到许多人主动伸出援手，无论他们是否拥有教练或指导者的正式头衔。若设立正式的新人引导工作组或指导者计划，不应为社区成员设置过高门槛。最重要的资质应当是助人之心，而非社区资历或技术专长等次要因素。引导者无需通晓所有答案，他们的核心价值在于帮助新人更快找到解决方案，并确保新人不会孤立无援。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加

当新社区成员适应环境并感到足够自在，准备开始为开源项目做贡献时，他们接下来会问：\"我可以在哪里贡献？\" 因此，为帮助新人快速入门，你可以整理一份适合新成员处理的工作清单。许多社区会在问题追踪系统中为任务标注\"适合首次贡献者\"、\"新手友好\"或\"需要帮助\"等标签，让新人能轻松识别可立即参与的任务。这类标注的任务可能涉及文档纠错、简单漏洞修复等基础工作，帮助新贡献者获得早期成就感，从而建立信心。在这些任务中指定联系人（担任指导者或指导者角色）以便提供起步协助也很有裨益。请始终谨记：对资深成员看似简单的任务，对新晋者而言未必容易。 许多开源社区会组织旨在连接成员的活动。无论是线下聚会还是线上会议，这些活动都为社区成员提供了绝佳的同步协作机会——并在此过程中增进彼此了解。活动形式可以是峰会、黑客马拉松、用户大会等。在这些场合中，建议专门为新成员设计特别议程或开辟专属空间。若预算允许，可安排正式的迎新环节作为\"零日\"活动；或举办午餐交流会，让新成员结识其他社区伙伴，便于后续咨询请教。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加

\"首先，[明确的治理]有助于提升组织的透明度感，\"他写道。\"人们可以了解一个团队考虑问题需要多长时间，贡献有多大可能对组织产生影响，或者当他们发声时谁会听到他们的声音。其次，明确定义治理模式也可能帮助人们更好地理解和分类开放组织的运作方式。\" 这里有一个实际案例：2018 年，Kubernetes

许多项目通过展示项目的市场潜力来吸引其他供应商参与贡献。供应商通常不会对开源项目进行持续性投入，除非他们能证明这种投资的合理性。因此，在这个阶段，展示软件拥有大量热情的用户群体至关重要。初期工作重点在于加速采用势头，并通过邀请用户积极参与项目路线图和项目推广，成功将他们转化为贡献者。 另一种方式是，项目可以尝试通过鼓励合作者在共同平台上\"构建\"来与其他供应商建立联系。虽然企业可能无法证明对项目\"核心\"进行大量投资的合理性，但如果项目扩展成本相对较低且能支持其业务，他们可能会愿意投资于项目扩展。 例如，通过将初期推广和参与工作的重点放在 API、扩展的开发体验以及扩展开发者的分发路径上，项目可以培育出大量基于平台构建的供应商社区，而非直接修改平台核心代码。区分\"核心\"与\"外围\"这两个开发领域，通常需要针对各自特点制定治理规则（例如，只有特定项目角色才被允许在\"核心\"区域进行操作）。 当企业发起的项目展现出巨大市场机遇时（无论是通过证明项目填补了市场重要空白，还是直接积累了庞大用户群），便可与潜在供应商合作伙伴展开项目协作。这类讨论既涉及技术层面，也聚焦商业考量。 在投入大量项目资源之前，供应商通常会提出以下问题： 我们能否在公平竞争的环境中参与项目？还是说利益相关方对不同供应商的变更采用不同评估流程（例如贡献者许可协议赋予原始供应商比其他方更多的权利）？从法律角度确保公平竞争的常见做法是将项目管理和商标权移交给基金会。 该项目是否满足客户需求？供应商会评估市场契合度，以及项目如何融入其产品组合。 接纳更多供应商参与可能对项目治理产生重大影响。缓解潜在动荡影响的一种方法是瞄准与原始供应商不存在直接竞争关系的供应商。例如，云托管公司招募本地软件产品供应商加入其项目，可能比招募竞争性托管供应商更易成功。只有当项目能证明其长期保持多供应商参与的记录时，竞争性供应商才可能愿意加入。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加 » 项目和社区治理 »

基金会、云原生计算基金会、Eclipse 基金会、OpenStack 基金会或软件自由保护协会等），请求基金会接管该项目。 开源项目在选择以这种方式合作的基金会时，必须考虑以下几个因素： 成本结构； 基金会规定的治理要求； 基金会与项目用户及开发者群体的亲密度。 此时，项目通常会探讨会员费用应在多大程度上影响项目的技术治理。对此存在两种主流治理模式。 首先是资金投入与技术投入的严格分离，最高级别会员对项目预算事项（例如资金在基础设施、人员配置、市场营销、活动等方面的分配）拥有决策权并可施加影响，但技术治理完全由技术价值决定。其次是\"纯会员\"组织模式，会员有权委派代表加入技术治理委员会，该委员会负责监督哪些子项目将被纳入主项目以及项目的具体治理方式。 基金会在项目发展过程中还能扮演另一关键角色：界定围绕项目的市场动态，包括对项目商标的管理。商标是开源项目最宝贵的资源之一，它能确保供应商以不损害项目声誉的方式分发项目（或其衍生品）。开源项目通常利用商标认证来\"加持\"市场上的特定供应商产品，或影响衍生品的行为方式。 某些项目坚持认为贡献者仅代表_个人_，而非其任职公司的代表。在成熟的开源项目（如 Linux

文件的一部分，或者介于两者之间的任何形式。重要的是将基本运作方式以文字形式记录下来，让有意参与项目的人知道该去哪里、该与谁交流，最重要的是不会感到措手不及。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加 » 项目和社区治理 »

与技术文档类似，治理文档应当如实阐明实际运作机制。若存在愿景目标，应将其归入\"路线图\"或\"待办事项\"的独立章节。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加 » 项目和社区治理 » 诚实的重要性","id":"157","title":"诚实的重要性"},"158":{"body":"如前所述，你的项目将包含多种实际角色，但初期只需定义少数几个基础角色即可。这些基本角色包括： 成员 贡献者 领导者 无论你是否考虑过，你的项目中已经包含了所有这些角色。每一个角色都应记录在某种形式的角色文档中，无论是项目文档还是主源代码仓库。这能让你将隐性的内容显性化，既为参与者设定预期，也让更多人有机会加入项目。对于每个角色，你需要定义：担任者是谁、如何获得该角色资格、预期职责范围、以及享有的权利与特权。未来你还会超越这些基础角色，定义更多具体职能。但仅详细规范这三类角色，就能为项目发展奠定坚实基础。 成员 这可能是开源领域中最普遍却最缺乏文档记录的角色。成员是指参与你项目并因此获得认可的个人或组织。根据项目运作方式的不同，成员可以是邮件列表订阅者、赞助企业、知名终端用户、活动参与者或基金会成员。在某些项目中，\"成员\"与\"贡献者\"是同义词，但多数情况下并非如此。大多数项目都拥有更庞大的外围群体——他们以某种方式参与项目，但并未积极贡献代码或内容。 界定成员身份需要明确项目实际服务的对象，这始终是个关键问题。主要赞助企业的客户是否自动成为项目成员？企业能否作为成员，还是仅限于个人？终端用户属于成员范畴，抑或仅能作为贡献者存在？最重要的是，定义成员身份意味着明确项目领导者需要倾听的对象范围。 对于几乎所有项目，都需要明确规定成员需遵守哪些规则（通常是行为准则，内容不宜过多），以及他们能从领导者和贡献者那里获得什么。尤其重要的是说明成员应如何参与项目，比如\"成员需使用新问题模板在本仓库提交_错误报告_\"。大多数人只要获得清晰指引，都会很乐意按照你指明的路径参与贡献。 在采用民主选举领导机制的项目中，\"成员\"这一角色可以被更严格地定义，因为成员身份可能附带投票权。这就要求更审慎地筛选成员资格，以防止选票操纵或干扰选举程序。 贡献者 有书面贡献者定义的项目远比想象中少得多。在源代码公开托管时代，人们常默认将 GitHub 或 GitLab 统计中的所有人都视为贡献者。但界定\"谁是本项目的贡献者\"可能出人意料地困难。 是任何在邮件列表发过言的人就算贡献者，还是需要合并 100 个拉取请求？仅限代码贡献者，还是包含所有类型的贡献者？那些组织活动和进行宣传的人呢？为赞助公司工作的员工是否自动被视为贡献者，还是必须通过个人努力获得资格？三年前贡献了大量代码但此后再无动作的人呢？谁会被列入发布致谢名单，以何种方式？ 围绕这些问题的讨论往往比书面文件对项目产生的影响更为深远。 贡献者这一角色还需要你为其设定更多关于工作回报的期望。这不仅包括解释项目的知识产权规则（例如贡献者是否仍拥有其代码所有权），还涉及诸如贡献者提交的内容预计多久会得到审核及是否被采纳等问题。通常，你还应说明贡献者将如何因其参与而获得认可。 这也是一个明确制定贡献者需遵循规则的地方。例如，某些项目要求贡献者或其雇主签署文件，正式共享其版权或其他知识产权（下文将详述）。你可能还会要求贡献者完成特定事项以协助维护项目，例如审阅他人提交的内容或协助文档编写。 领导者 正如我们所指出的，每个项目都有领导者，即使这些领导者未被明确指定。因此，至少需要透明地明确谁是项目的领导者，以便决策过程清晰可循。许多项目还会说明成为领导者的资格和程序，无论是通过委员会选拔、选举产生，还是仅基于职位任命。如果项目具有更复杂的治理结构，这些内容应写入专门的选拔/选举程序文件（参见下文）；若结构简单，选拔流程可直接作为角色说明文件的一部分。 很少有项目会在领导角色文档中明确其他部分：领导者的权力与限制、他们的职责，以及人员如何退出该角色（自愿或非自愿）。至关重要的是，每个人都必须清楚了解领导者权限的边界及其责任范围，否则领导者与其他项目成员之间会产生大量冲突。当领导团队需要决定罢免一位已停止参与但不愿辞职的项目领导者时，成文的职责描述将发挥巨大作用。 若你的项目正试图招募新的或额外的领导者，那么明确列出领导者需满足的详细资质要求同样至关重要。与某些预期相反，详尽的资质标准恰恰为渴望在项目中晋升的成员提供了明确的奋斗目标。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加 » 项目和社区治理 »

项目通常采用以下三种方式之一来界定投票者与候选人群体： **高门槛：**投票者属于内部核心群体——如代码提交者、维护者和核心贡献者。成员资格需具备长期参与经历，并获得同僚认可的高级资历。 **中等门槛：**只要符合明确定义的参与标准，活跃贡献者或基金会成员即可参与投票。 **低门槛：**任何人只需完成注册项目或加入邮件列表等基本步骤，即可获得投票资格。 制定活动指标和界定\"参与\"资格的最低标准容易引发争议，主要因为这涉及人为划定合格参与者的边界。通常项目方会要求选举人必须满足可量化的持续参与条件。 选举中一个常见的担忧是选票灌水或群体效应——大公司凭借庞大的投票集团主导代表机构，或者候选人的朋友仅为了支持特定候选人而轻易跨过低门槛成为投票者。然而在大多数情况下，这类担忧并无根据。技术社区常试图制定规则来防范可能的制度滥用，但正如《计算机程序设计艺术》作者高德纳的名言：\" 过早优化是万恶之源 [1] \"，这些规则往往属于\"过早优化\"。更好的做法通常是避免特殊规则，待选举流程出现问题后再针对性解决。 最后需要考虑的是成为选举候选人的流程。最普遍的做法是自我提名，候选人发布选举信息及参选理由。另一种方式是他人提名，这通常与自我提名无异，因为候选人往往会主动请他人提名自己并附议支持。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加 » 项目和社区治理 »

其中一部分原因在于我们根本无法预知未来——你确实无法预判哪项贡献或哪位贡献者将对项目产生持久影响。例如，大量微小贡献的累积效应，很可能与少数几个引人注目的大型贡献产生同等影响力。某位参与者可能只是短暂参加了用户体验研讨会，却在无意间通过这次短暂互动提供了具有持久价值的见解。

：\"计算机文档长期处于类似政府拨款的尴尬境地：没人愿意出力编写，但每个人都希望需要时能随手可得。\"本节将逐步指导你如何创建文档。 提议一份文档 如果你发现某个项目或团队的文档存在缺失，可以直接联系项目负责人或在社区论坛询问是否有人正在撰写相关主题的文档。在 GitHub 和 GitLab 等支持\"问题追踪\"的平台上，你也可以通过创建 issue 来申请文档，但更简单的做法是先非正式地询问是否已有人在编写此类文档。 若发现已有人正在编写你认为必要的文档，可以主动申请成为审阅者。有时你甚至能以作者身份参与协作，但作者必须注意清晰明确地划分不同作者负责的主题范围。文档的模块化程度通常不如软件代码。 如果确认无人撰写该文档，且社区或项目负责人支持创建新文档，接下来要考虑的是：谁是最合适的作者？通常答案就是：你自己。虽然可能有其他更熟悉该主题的专家，但如果他们尚未创建这份文档，很可能是因为忙于其他事务、不擅长写作或其他原因。最理想的作者就是有撰写意愿的人，既然你提出了这个需求，很可能你就是最佳人选。主题专家可以为你提供思路并审核文稿。 此时应当正式发布公告，例如通过创建问题。建议设定截止日期以施加完成文档的压力。需注意文档需要经过评审，这可能会使项目延长数周。建立里程碑也很有帮助，例如： 开始撰写 分发初稿征求意见 初稿审阅周期结束 终稿传阅 终稿审阅周期结束 提交审核 审核通过并发布 项目文档需经项目负责人或顾问团队批准后方可纳入。这些领导者应以开放态度审批文档项目，因为任何与项目相关的新文档通常都能为部分成员带来价值。 成为作者 获得领导层批准撰写文件后，请按以下步骤操作。 学习使用工具 了解团队偏好的文档格式（如 Asciidoc、Markdown 等）。大多数项目会将文档像源代码文件一样集成管理，这样项目组就无需为文档相关任务（如提交文档错误报告）专门开发特殊工具和流程。 熟悉相关文档资料 在研究是否需要新文档时，你可能已查阅过项目现有文档。在开始撰写前，你还应进行网络搜索，查看类似项目的文档资料。收集相关文档链接及其他辅助材料（如为读者提供背景知识的视频，或文档阅读后可深入研究的进阶信息来源）。 查阅由你的项目或其他类似主题项目编写的现有文档，或许能帮助你快速入门。寻找针对与你目标受众（如开发者、终端用户等）相匹配的群体所撰写的文档。 写作标准 写作是一项需要不同熟练程度的技能，但遵循一些基本准则能帮助经验不足的作者撰写出实用的文档。 始终考虑你的写作对象。选定主题后，明确受众是文档规划中最重要的环节。不妨自问：大多数读者是否理解我使用的专业术语？终端用户是否需要了解开发者讨论的技术细节？在讲解资源使用方法前，是否需要先说明如何找到该网页或其他资源？ 尽量将操作指南分解为分步骤的流程说明。这类分步指南通常最容易遵循，特别是当以有序列表形式呈现时。切勿仅凭记忆撰写：务必在编写时亲自操作一遍流程。否则，几乎肯定会遗漏某个步骤或出现描述错误。 构建文档结构。保持句子简短。尝试拆分长段落。频繁设置新标题。如果你发现某个章节写了十几段甚至更多，却不知如何将其拆分为更小的部分，那你可能在组织一篇结构混乱、行文不畅的草稿。 文档撰写阶段 通常，作者在撰写文档前应提交大纲供评审。大纲能确保涵盖所有重要主题，同时避免包含不必要的内容。评审者也可提出结构调整建议。但作者在实际撰写时，往往会找到理由新增主题或调整其位置。 相关文档引用是大多数文档的重要组成部分。正如前文所述，作者应当通过调查研究找到相关文档并予以收录。内联链接尤其有助于引导读者了解背景知识——当他们需要学习某些基础知识才能理解文档时。不过，通常在文档末尾提供参考资料章节最为实用。 审阅文档 文档审阅采用众包模式，这意味着我们欢迎来自不同知识背景、能力水平、专业培训、种族、性别、地理位置等多元人群的审阅意见。这种方式能显著提升文档的价值与可读性。 你可以指出你认为不正确或遗漏的内容。请理解我们尽量保持文档简洁，以便忙碌的人们有时间阅读。提供优质文档和其他资源的参考信息非常有价值。 编辑、校对和拼写检查同样是宝贵的贡献方式。 审阅文档是熟悉我们语气与风格的绝佳途径，为日后撰写自己的文件做好准备。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加 » 了解社区角色 »

因此，自我保健是一种有意识、用心地实践基本活动，以促进我们身体、情感、人际关系乃至灵性层面的健康。大多数人日常已通过采取保护整体健康的行动（如健康饮食、锻炼和充足睡眠）进行自我保健。但有时我们会发现，仅靠这些行为不足以维持健康——需要有意识地寻求额外支持。 当我们处于愉悦的心理状态时，通常能更有效地应对压力。通过实践自我保健，我们可以增强对生活中不可避免的压力源的适应力。 这种自我保健概念在理论上看似简单，却常被忽视或忽略——尤其是社区管理者。让我们来探讨（并解构）其中的一些原因。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加 » 社区管理者的自我关护 »

当困境来临时，带领社区渡过难关往往既是我们的责任，也是我们的心愿。但要做到这点，我们必须首先保持最佳状态。也就是说，唯有先妥善关照自我，才能以可持续的方式照顾他人。否则我们将永远无法从容应对各种挑战——在与多元个性互动、解决冲突、做出艰难决策的同时还要兼顾长期目标时，挑战总会不期而至。正因如此，自我健康管理才显得尤为重要。

。若我们处于焦虑或压力中，他人会感知到这种情绪并以自身的负能量加剧它。我们在应对某些极具毒性的社区成员影响他人时能观察到这种现象，却未能意识到自己也可能在无意识中过度影响他人。同理，当我们真正处于愉悦状态时，人们往往会被这种积极情绪感染，从而变得更具效率。 简而言之：要想激发他人最好的一面，我们必须先展现出自己最好的一面。 作为领导者，我们拥有为社区带来积极改变的巨大潜力。让我们善用这份力量。抓住每个机会运用你的影响力来鼓励和倡导自我健康管理——不仅为了社区的利益，也为了你自己。了解自我健康管理对你而言意味着什么，并将这种理解与团队分享。社区管理者无需透露内心最深处的恐惧或焦虑，但仅仅开启一场关于自我健康管理重要性的对话，就能带来益处，不仅对运营社区的团队如此，对整个社区亦然。

对自身保持诚实与对社区保持诚实同等重要。如果我们不能诚实地面对自己，无法与情绪状态和谐共处，就可能在社区中无意激化矛盾（因为我们未能意识到：或许应该暂时退后一步，直到能以更清晰的思路妥善处理问题）。 维持这种情感劳动可能令人崩溃。我们必须承认并接受：完美无法企及，更重要的是——这从来不是成为优秀领导者的必要条件。真正重要的是人们能感受到你作为普通人的一面。 人们会被与自己 有共鸣 [6] 的人所吸引，而能够识别这种共鸣感正是一名优秀社区管理者的标志。如果你的成员发现你具备他们能产生共鸣的特质，他们就更易对你产生共情。有趣的是，我们常强调对成员或团队展现同理心的重要性，但同样关键的是成员们也需对我们展现出理解与感激。 当团队或社区中的每个人都培养这种共情能力时，彼此间的联系与信任会逐渐加深，进而帮助他们建立起非正式的社交支持网络。这个网络可以成为传递自我健康管理重要性的渠道，创造不带评判的安全空间，或为个体成员（包括你自己）提供情绪宣泄、压力释放或分担工作的避风港。 难免会有成员期望你扮演全知全能、永不犯错的队长角色，但通过有效的自我健康管理实践以及社交支持网络中成员的支持，你将更有信心应对这些压力源。同时你也会明白，正是自身的脆弱性让你成为更优秀的社区领导者。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加 » 社区管理者的自我关护 »

职业过劳可能影响我们每个人，无论身处何种行业。然而，在那些长期消耗心智与情感的岗位上，这种现象似乎更为普遍。究其原因，往往与这些岗位中盛行的无私精神有关—— 人们习惯于将他人置于首位 [8] ：无论是为了客户还是社群，他们总是不遗余力地营造愉悦满足的环境或氛围。 这种现象 在科技行业中也日益普遍 [9] 。究其原因，往往被归咎于业内近乎常态的全天候工作文化和激烈竞争氛围，导致科技从业者——尤其是软件开发人员——长期处于超负荷状态，精神耗竭至危及健康的地步。 必须强调，工作相关压力与职业过劳截然不同。适度的压力在可控且暂时的情况下，反而能成为动力源泉。然而，当职业压力长期持续、演变为慢性状态，并开始侵蚀我们的整体福祉时，便可能发展为所谓的\"职业过劳\"。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加 » 社区管理者的自我关护 » 过劳","id":"194","title":"过劳"},"195":{"body":"职业过劳极难被察觉，这不仅因其症状隐蔽且呈渐进性发展，更因它常被误诊为早期阶段更短暂、更常见的职场压力。二者症状相似，直到为时已晚，问题已演变成更严重、更难治愈的深层次病症。 自 20 世纪 70 年代以来，心理学家赫伯特·弗罗伊登伯格陆续出版了多部著作并发表文章，阐述他对职业过劳潜在诱因、影响及作用机制的研究成果。 他的工作 [10] 帮助界定了职业过劳的不同症状表现，从而划分出经历过劳的各个阶段。 或许你发现自己符合其中多项特征，或许仅符合一两条。识别这些征兆并非易事，因为它们不仅随时间推移逐渐显现，还常被我们\"一切正常\"的自我否认心理所掩盖。 崩溃 精力流失与随之而来的疲惫感往往是最初的警示信号，尤其当你本是 精力充沛之人 [11] 时更需警惕。但要注意，若发现自己难以维持日常活动节奏，切莫强迫自己硬撑。这样做只会让问题恶化。 与情绪同理，我们的能量状态也会影响周围人。我们通常通过实现目标、收获回报来补充能量，并将这份能量传递给他人。若因精力不足而无法获得回报，便会陷入恶性循环。 那些曾让我们兴奋的事——比如开完会后斗志昂扬地要去达成目标——如今变得索然无味，被视为对已濒临枯竭能量的过度消耗。你可能像他人那样察觉不到成就缺失，因为你越来越觉得获取回报无关紧要，并将疲倦归咎于日益增加的工作量。 疏离 我们常以疏离或冷漠作为自我保护的手段，来抵御情绪压力或痛苦。当开始对周遭情境或人事感到失望时——无论是团队、社区、公司，甚至我们自己——我们往往会贬低其重要性：\"我不在乎，反正这也没什么大不了的\"，并逐渐远离曾全心投入的事物。这样做固然能削弱它们对我们的负面影响力，却也同时阻断了其带来积极影响的可能性，最终可能导致孤独与孤立。 过劳与愤世嫉俗 当你对曾经热衷的事物逐渐疏离后，会发现自己越来越难对周围发生的一切保持兴趣。你开始质疑自身活动的价值、人际关系的意义，乃至生命中更宏大的层面。这种状态可能使人变得多疑，甚至对他人的动机与事业心生猜忌。 焦躁易怒与敏感易激 精力旺盛的人通常还带有一种轻微的急躁特性，无论是对于他人还是自己。因为他们能够快速完成事情，继而转向下一项任务。然而，当遭遇过劳时，我们会产生必须超额完成任务的错觉，随之而来的就是达成目标的急躁感。这种急躁可能转化为对周围人的易怒情绪。那些曾经微不足道的小事会变成巨大障碍，而我们往往将责任归咎于他人而非自己。 全能感 我们起初并不会对自己的角色有这种感觉，但常常在工作压力过大时，会不自觉地陷入一种情绪：“这件事只有我能做，别人都做不了。” 这类言论往往是为了证明过度投入的努力是合理的，并赋予其价值，尽管我们工作量的其他方面正在失败。这是在情况失控时试图抓住控制权的表现。 请放心，其他人确实能完成这些任务，虽然方式不同，可能也达不到你所能做到的那种卓越程度，但有些情况并不总是需要追求完美。这类自我中心主义往往阻碍了进步和他人的主动性。 一种不被赏识的猜疑 为了弥补精力的不足，我们往往会加倍努力，但这未必能带来理想的效果。然而我们意识不到这一点，只盯着自己付出的辛劳。于是我们开始觉得团队或社区中的其他人不够重视自己——\"他们难道看不见我熬夜工作的辛苦吗？\"这种情绪可能演变为怨恨与愤怒。 妄想症 从感到不被重视的迹象，逐渐演变为感觉整个世界都在与自己为敌 [12] 。当事情出错，而我们却无法理解或看清原因时，我们往往会寻找一个非自身的指责对象——即便这种指控毫无根据。通常，被贴上\"罪魁祸首\"标签的人会成为我们发泄挫败感的目标，这可能是团队成员、朋友，甚至家人。 迷失方向感 迷失方向感是指我们感到与周围环境分离，无法理解身边正在发生的事情。当你发现自己身处一种未曾察觉的境况，或是突然意识到原本理解的概念现在变得陌生时，就会出现这种状态。我们开始发现自己容易遗忘，注意力持续时间不断下降，这导致我们陷入更深的困惑与焦躁，进而加剧了诸如偏执妄想等其他症状。 心身性不适 此处不应误解为暗示经历过劳迹象的人不会感到身体不适；他们确实可能并确实会有身体不适。但这确实强调了，长期压力下，身体疾病症状会作为原因的次要表现出现，比如反复感冒、背痛、头痛等。有时候，这些疾病掩盖了我们内心深处更强烈的情感压力，而我们更倾向于请病假而非真正承认精神上的压力。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加 » 社区管理者的自我关护 »

内卷（高强度工作） ：强迫心理被误解为奉献与投入。这可能表现为不愿委派工作（担心失去绝对控制权），或更加拼命延长工作时间。 忽视自己需求 ：工作开始占据主导地位，睡眠、健康饮食等基本需求与生活乐趣被视为不必要的琐事。 冲突转移 ：来自他人的冲突被视为多管闲事和威胁。人们会启动应对机制来回避问题，这些机制可能演变为身体崩溃。 价值观扭曲 ：只关注工作，导致价值观和人际关系被扭曲。这会使它们遭到忽视或抛弃。 对出现问题的否认 ：建立防御机制来抵御生活冲击及其要求。逐渐变得无法容忍不确定性且拒绝接受现实；将焦虑与不安向外投射。 社恐 ：与自身情感及他人疏离。常通过电视、书籍或酒精/药物等方式\"逃避\"。 出现异常行为 ：亲友会注意到当事人态度、语言或身体活动等方面日益明显的行为改变。 人格解体 ：对自身及他人需求的认知显著贬低和漠视。。 空心病 ：感到空洞无意义。虽有填补的渴望，但往往只是短暂缓解或虚假慰藉，最终仍无法获得满足。 抑郁 ：陷入无望与无欢的心境。绝望与崩溃成为主导情绪，逃离现状的欲望压倒一切。 过劳综合征 ：出现自杀念头，身心崩溃至危及生命的境地。此时必须立即寻求专业医疗救助。 这些区分有助于我们发现自身、团队或社区成员在活动中的消极变化，以及他们对待自己和他人态度的恶化。

简而言之，仅仅 作为 一个开源项目并不保证该项目会拥有社区。但这意味着 当 它 确实 拥有一个社区时，它可以收获开源软件特有的某些好处。 在组建开源软件社区时，你将面临与组建任何其他实践社群相同的伦理和组织考量。实践社群是指一群拥有共同兴趣的人，他们聚集在一起在共同领域内学习和实践。例如，扬琴演奏者每年聚会分享演奏艺术与实践知识，或者滑板爱好者每周在公园聚集学习新技巧，这些都是实践社群的体现。

开源软件社区如同所有实践社群，确实能将来自迥异世界的人们凝聚在一起。在开源社区中，拥有共同兴趣（共享实践）的人们联合起来，通过协作实现学习与成长（ 社区 ）。 组建开源社区时你可能还需考虑： 你希望获得开放协作与创新的红利。或许你已拥有或正在规划一项新技术，而开源是寻找志同道合者的途径。也可能你单纯觉得这种方式契合你的计划。 吸引爱好者加入你的项目是 增长战略

你的组织本质上是开放、协作且具有社区属性的。你可以创建规模适中的开源项目，让用户与贡献者以某种方式紧密联结。例如大学里的合作者：如果没有法律障碍阻止项目启动，何不尝试发起一个？你永远不知道未来会有谁发现它并从中受益。 构建任何社区都非易事。在为开源项目定义最佳实践时，需考量社区的以下方面： 许多人刚加入时还是新手。一些人需要接受所开发技术的培训，一些人需要学习工具使用，而大多数人则需要学习如何在团队中有效协作。 人们喜欢自己的贡献得到认可，尤其是作为志愿者时。 在宣传和社区建设方面的非技术贡献常常被忽视或低估。 性别、种族和能力方面的多样性对产品面向广大用户群体的实用性影响重大，但实现这种多样性却十分困难。

在这个时代，我们越来越难以从物理上脱离工作生活。科技带来的便利让我们几乎时刻保持在线状态，也因此与线上社群紧密相连。不分昼夜查看邮件或在社交媒体上回复社群成员，已成为普遍现象。 除了物理层面的困难，我们在情感上也可能难以从工作中抽离。我们常误以为 24 小时待命、即时响应是体现关怀和活跃社群的职责要求。但事实往往并非如此，这种做法反而会阻碍可持续社群的构建以及与成员的高质量互动。优秀的领导者无需回复所有信息也能成就卓越。 每个人的工作与生活平衡点各不相同，优先级也因人而异。此时，自我健康管理活动在划分工作与个人生活的界限中起着关键作用。你需要明确界定哪些行为属于工作范畴——比如回复社区请求或邮件、安排电话会议等——并设定专注工作的时段；除此之外的时间，请向自己和他人明确传达这是属于你的私人时间。通过坚持规划明确的下班时间，我们会逐渐形成身心都能预期并期待的习惯，从而更易于培养和维持这种良性作息。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加

项目的用户群体是谁？ 目前如何与用户群体互动？ 你的项目存在哪些替代方案？ 你能与相关的项目紧密合作吗？ 你对这个项目的目标是什么？ 谁是你的关键利益相关者？ 在项目启动之初，这些问题思考得越透彻，成功的可能性就越大。","breadcrumbs":"马上开始 » 社区建设要点 »

工作成瘾与其他成瘾行为一样，起初很难意识到问题的存在。受工作成瘾困扰的人往往自我否认，说服自己工作是种乐趣。但这种过度投入时间精力、忽视人际关系与健康的状态，终将不可避免地导致崩溃。 关键在于建立与工作角色的健康关系，而非时刻保持全速运转。试着评估：真正驱动你取得成就的动机是什么？这种成就是否需要你保持当前的在线时长？你是否依赖外界赞扬来确认工作价值？是否觉得离开后社区就会崩溃？识别那些愉悦时刻——无论是完成任务，还是获得社区成员或上司的称赞——并评估是否仍需维持当前的体验强度。 我们也可以发现，这种需要证明的需求实际上是对团队资源不足导致工作负担过重的反应——试图向他人证明该角色及团队为项目或公司带来的价值。 重新审视这些目标，以减少工作量。在当前资源下，能否在不牺牲质量和良好工作生活平衡的前提下实现并维持这些目标？如果无法做到，请优先考虑并传达团队能达成的最具影响力的目标。其他任务可委派给合适的成员或设定更灵活的时间节点，同时预留出处理突发问题的时间作为截止日期的一部分。 这不仅有助于为团队成员设定合理的预期目标，更强调健康的工作生活平衡是他们日程安排中不可或缺的部分。这种可预测的时间安排也能让你为公司或社区提供更准确的前景预测。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加 » 社区管理者的自我关护 »

这些界限也能帮助社区认可并接受你对他们的期望，以及他们能从你这里获得什么。尽可能保持透明，明确你的可用时间，并制定在非工作时间获取帮助的升级流程。强调记录社区流程的重要性，让成员们在遇到问题时（无论是否需要协助）都能更清楚地知道该做什么。目的是建立一个稳定的时间安排，并让团队和社区都予以尊重。虽然他们可能不会每次都做到，但你可以利用这些界限来避免内疚感，开始将个人时间视为自己的权利，同时也尊重他人的时间。 当然，如果在休息时间出现需要你干预的严重事件，务必建立机制让团队能够处理，而不是只有你\"才能搞定\"。这些机制可以是升级流程，或是团队协作共同响应和评估处理方案。这有助于培养\"人人都能分担压力\"的心态，尤其是在问题侵占你和他人的个人时间时。 维护个人边界同样至关重要。我们的职责常要求协助成员处理工作负荷及团队成员间的人际沟通问题。但必须清醒认识到，我们无法解决所有人际矛盾或冲突——有时过度介入反而适得其反。 尽管不愿承认，当发现某位成员明显需要专业心理干预时，我们必须尊重自身能力的边界。若对话或事态明显超出常规人际范畴，应引导其寻求专业医疗或精神科帮助。辅助成员是我们的职责，但明确职责边界才是对双方真正的负责。 建议你与团队参与心理健康相关培训，掌握处理社区或团队成员心理状况的应对方法。这能帮助建立标准化流程，当遇到超出能力范围的个案时，可遵循既定的专业指引妥善处置。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加 » 社区管理者的自我关护 »

当我们对自己或社区设定不切实际的期望时，事情就会变得难以为继。就自身而言，我们可能因将个人动力纳入评估而低估项目周期——那种能推动我们跨越最后障碍的激情。但动力并非取之不竭，它会因内外因素剧烈波动。请将动力视为独立变量——即使你对项目充满热情，也别让这份激情影响你对项目耗时的客观判断。否则，你可能会发现工作与生活的平衡正因此受到损害。 我们常常会错误地揣测社区中其他人的动机。从定义上说，社区成员都是志愿者，当然我们很幸运能拥有那些超越职责要求的杰出成员。但我们不应期待所有人都如此，事实上我们应该预见到工作延迟并为此做好准备。 通过建立清晰的边界、降低工作负荷预期并改进时间预估，你开始能够兑现切实可行的时间表。想象你在一周内完成任务而非耗费三倍时间，这是因为：你将其明确为优先事项；将次要任务分派给团队（或明确告知某些工作无需完成）；仅在分配时间内专注工作；并通过专门离线时间来恢复心理能量。这种工作流程与方法的组合是实现成功的关键，既能持续提供和获得正向反馈，也有助于降低成员产生过劳的可能性。 唯一永恒不变的只有时间，因此要意识到你为自己和他人设定的奖励机制可能会随时间而改变。定期抽空反思驱动你及社区的动力源泉，积极审视已取得的进展，并评估现有资源以相应调整项目目标——在可能的情况下，尽量不影响健康的工作生活平衡。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加 » 社区管理者的自我关护 »

回顾会议现在几乎是软件开发团队中不可或缺的一部分，用于持续提升个人或团队的表现和士气，并识别需要解决的问题。然而，我们发现我们很少为自己、与自己做回顾。 内省是指对自身意识思维和感受的检视。这既可以指心理状态，也可以从灵性层面理解为对灵魂的探求。自我反思、内省与自我健康管理相互交织，共同致力于推动并维持心智成长与发展的积极方向。 自省对我们至关重要，它能帮助我们评估自身行为、思想和行动背后的动机与获得感。鉴于工作是生活的重要组成部分，我们需要确保自己在社区及公司中的角色与个人价值观相符。否则，当角色带来的回报与预期不符时，不满情绪便会与日俱增。 但首先我们需要明确自己的价值观、从这一角色中获得的乐趣特质，以及我们喜欢共事者的特点。 花些时间认真回答这些问题，因为这种自我认知并非一蹴而就。利用这些答案来反思你在日常行为中的感受，无论是积极的还是消极的。写日记通常是厘清思绪的一种简单而有效的方式。

冒充者综合征患者往往难以内化和接纳自身成就，他们习惯弱化积极反馈，并将他人工作与自身进行比较。当我们开始新工作、承担新职责或角色、或是结束职业空窗期重返岗位时，这种情况更易发生。为补偿这种长期自我怀疑，我们开始加班工作、拖延事务，或以不必要的方式试图证明自身价值的合理性。 Dr. Valerie Young 进一步将患者认为胜任所需具备的这些错误思维类型划分 [19] 为以下几种子类： 完美主义者 完美主义与冒名顶替综合征往往相伴而生。当完美主义者未能达到他们不合理的高标准时，就会质疑自己的能力，进而怀疑自己是否配得上现有的职位。即便他们成功实现了目标，似乎总存在某些他们预期达到却未能企及的目标，或是他们以为自己应该掌握却未能获得的知识。 天才 这些受困者认为，完成一项任务的天然能力直接等同于他们的个人价值。若需耗费过长时间掌握某件事，他们便会觉得这件事不值得投入。他们不仅设定严苛标准，还要求自己必须毫不费力地达成目标。 独行侠 这类人羞于寻求帮助，唯恐暴露他们在他人眼中的真实形象——一个冒牌货。尽管独立自主是美德，但若拒绝承认\"三个臭皮匠顶个诸葛亮\"的道理，往往会导致平庸的成果。 专家 患有这种冒名顶替综合征的人常常否定自己的成就，因为他们认为自己尚未掌握该领域或角色的全部知识。这类人通常不愿被置于聚光灯下，唯恐暴露出自己未知的方面而被视为骗子。 超人 这类人往往会过度与行业内的佼佼者进行比较，并强迫自己投入更多时间和精力以追赶他人。他们往往极度依赖外部认可来确认自我价值。 由于社区管理者这个角色在科技行业中相对新颖且尚未完全确立，我们常因该领域专业知识和文献的匮乏而难以明确界定和验证自身决策。当公司或项目此前从未设立过社区管理者职位时，我们更容易产生\"即将被识破\"的焦虑感。 不过，有些方法可以帮助抑制冒名顶替综合征并增强自信心。","breadcrumbs":"贡献者不断增加 » 社区管理者的自我关护 »

看看你周围那些与你关系良好、让你感到可以信任的人。当你感到压力或只是想发泄不满时，依靠你的社交支持网络，以安全健康的方式释放情绪。这种压力的释放能帮助你理清情绪，在决策时获得更清晰的思路，或者仅仅通过与他们的交谈就让你心情愉悦。 我们可能会发现，社区中的那些朝夕相处的伙伴，逐渐成为了我们社会支持网络的一部分。每个人都以独特的方式为我们提供支持，在生活中给予不同形式的帮助。但同样要记住，我们也应当成为他人支持网络中的一环。 越是向成员普及自我健康管理的益处并加强沟通，就越能看到这种行为被实践和鼓励。这反过来有助于在社区中营造更加关怀与包容的氛围。教育可以采取多种形式：开展倡导自我健康管理的讨论、 举办心理健康宣传活动

下载量这个常见指标同样无法定义成功。人们很容易认为，若某软件项目拥有数百万次下载，其发展必然蒸蒸日上。但用户持续使用软件，并不意味着项目社区内部不存在隐患——可能导致项目停滞的因素比比皆是。反观许多极为成功的项目，它们既没有登上头条，也未曾引发大规模追捧。 既然金钱与声名都不是开源软件项目的成功要素，那么什么才是？ 对于开源项目而言，成功不仅通过商业或消费层面的成就来衡量。得益于分布式版本控制和协作工具的普及，自由开源项目的开发过程已变得高度透明。虽然这些基于 git 等工具确实为贡献者整合项目提供了巨大优势，但另一个好处是：它们还能让我们对项目进展进行更全面、更量化的观察。 过去，我们很难实时观察某个项目的流程是否成功。你只能看到项目的最终成果，却无法了解达成这些成果的具体步骤——至少需要付出极大努力才能知晓。因此，评估项目健康状况和成功与否往往依赖主观方法，通常基于那些已深植于多种文化中的社会学和商业导向原则。但现在，你可以轻松深入开源开发所呈现的数据，并利用这些数据推导出关于项目健康状况的量化信息。本节探讨的正是这些概念。 本节包含以下章节：

健康的定义会随着社区发展而动态变化。初期阶段，你需要投入大量精力打造对用户友好的健康社区，尤其要重视反馈机制的建立与管理。当项目逐步转型或成长为贡献者主导型时，\"健康\"的定义及其维护方式将呈现指数级复杂性。 然而，一旦你决定将建立基于贡献者的开源软件社区作为目标，就可以从一开始关注整体生态。一个理解贡献者层面需求并保持健康状态的项目，自然会将其健康态势传递至其他参与层级和终端用户。也就是说，健康的贡献者会通过其核心工作或衍生效应，直接致力于为他人创造安全健康的环境。 以\"友善\"为例，假设你认为这是贡献者之间应有的健康行为。对直接同伴友善是践行这种行为的一种方式。但在开源领域，我们会发现将友善延伸至每个进入项目生态的人，不仅能为他们带来良好体验，更会促使他们将这种友善传递到项目其他互动中。如果你的友善能让十位用户对贡献同伴更加友善，这份善意就已超越你直接给予同伴的范畴，产生了乘数效应。 我们主要从两个维度来评估开源社区的健康状况。

在网络社区（包括开源社区）中，普遍存在着追求即时爆发式增长的强烈驱动力。通常的做法是在尽可能多的合适场景中推广项目，导致许多人出于一时兴趣加入社区。往往还会产生一种强烈冲动——将早期采用者直接吸纳为代码提交者，以此营造出团队实力雄厚、运作良好的表象。 贡献社区成员——那些能影响项目实际发展方向的人——应根据其实际贡献程度、贡献价值及整体共识来选拔。若某人修复了多个关键漏洞，或许应授予其项目写入权限（及相应话语权）；但若同一人营造了有害的社区氛围，则不宜晋升为维护者。 同样值得关注的是核心社区成员，无论编码能力如何，都应奖励那些做出贡献的人。例如，考虑那些擅长帮助新用户但尚未尝试修复漏洞的成员——认可这些贡献能为该用户及其他人留下积极印象。正向激励会鼓励他人效仿受嘉奖的行为，进而使整个社区更加强大。 整个社区都应始终鼓励发展壮大，但要确保新成员是通过自身努力获得资格的。这并不意味着每个人必须时刻完美相处——个性冲突在所难免（某些情况下甚至很常见）。但社区整体不应让个别成员的意见主导此类关键决策，而应寻求共识，而非屈从于少数人的施压。 当然，成员的行为可能严重到需要采取应对措施。运用理性判断；考虑采取行动时是否会让人措手不及。","breadcrumbs":"衡量成功 » 定义健康社区 »

万万要注意保持所有讨论公开透明 即便这意味着需要在公开/存档的场所中止并重启对话，也要时刻牢记这一点。若未记录在公开档案中，则等同于不存在。这意味着当你们进行私下讨论时——这类非正式交谈确实会发生——参与者有责任尽可能完整地记录对话内容，过程中和结束时的笔记均可作为存档文件。讨论结果（涉及私人敏感信息除外）必须发送至主要公开存档的讨论区，例如社区邮件列表。请记住，这类私下讨论并非决策场合。你们可以形成建议，但最终决策必须提交更广泛的群体公开表决，确保所有人都有参与机会。信任但需验证。对参与式透明度的承诺，就是在共同信任银行中储蓄。\"相信我们就好\"式的闭门决策，则是从信任银行中支取。而这家银行，随时可能破产。 会议全程高度透明 任何私下交流——无论是走廊谈话、邮件/IRC 往来还是电话沟通——都会给项目带来风险。最起码，你必须注意汇报直接对话的结果。但这远远不够。会议纪要永远无法体现理性讨论的过程，实质上将社区排除在决策流程之外。成功的开源项目之所以将论坛、邮件列表、开放聊天网络以及代码库评论与日志作为所有沟通的基础，正是基于这个原因。 再小的决策节点也值得预先在邮件列表中公布 尽管我们可以培养社区对技术或其他决策的信任，但有些常见问题是可以避免的。企业赞助商和员工总是更容易受到质疑，因此需要格外注意共享决策过程。我们无法猜测哪些因素对贡献者重要，更不知其缘由。假定他们不关心某项决策是愚蠢的做法。正确做法是将所有决策都提交到开放论坛讨论，直到人们开始抱怨某类决策可以通过其他方式/场合作出。这种方法被称为\"用令人抓狂的透明度来建立信任证明\"。 失望可以接受，但措手不及绝不可取 没有人会喜欢每一个决定，失望在所难免。这是无法回避的生活现实。然而，任何人都不该感到意外——尤其是面对负面消息时。这种意外会严重打击士气，最终导致人员流失。有时我们因担心他人失望而选择隐瞒信息，但处理不当反而会让他们陷入\"既失望又意外\"的双重打击。必要时可通过私密渠道提前告知，尤其当对方可能不知情或无法获知某项决定时更应如此。若发现团队成员频繁感到意外，就必须彻底检视沟通方式——某些环节显然未能有效触达足够人群形成信息扩散。切勿将重要决定埋没在无人阅读的长篇文本中。就像软件补丁那样，当变更以独立模块的形式出现在邮件列表或博客聚合平台等公共空间时，人们更容易理解变化。有时需要将决策或讨论点拆分为独立问题，既让人看清局部细节，也能把握整体脉络。 如果你发现某个决定或细节在讨论中被忽略，可能导致他人遗漏，请设法突出显示，以免后续令人意外。 务必更加谨慎地在开放环境中做出所有设计决策 即便所有内容都采用开放资源完成，若设计决策通过线下会议、走廊交谈、午餐闲聊或日常通勤时讨论等方式做出，就等于将社区排除在真正重要的工作之外。人们会注意到这一点并在意。彼此交流本无可厚非，但请将其视为决策前讨论并遵循以下原则： 决策未经公共论坛讨论则不成立 结论若缺乏公开可见的论证过程与证据支持则不足为凭 结论若缺乏公开可见的论证过程与证据支持则不足为凭 流程中不应设置任何非公开的阻碍环节 任何可能阻碍发布或开发流程的内容都不应设为非公开状态。例如，你不希望出现这种情况：告诉社区某个私有测试环境出了问题，却无法重现问题供他们审查。你需要全面检查整个流程，找出非公开环节，并设法将其公开化。某些测试和开发基础设施可能目前处于非公开状态，需要制定方案使其公开。在某些情况下，（至少短期内）能做到的最佳方案是公开测试报告。最终你甚至可能需要帮助他人在公有云搭建类似环境，只为确保流程持续畅通。 对内容和代码都使用版本控制 这样每个人都能追踪变更。能够回退工作成果鼓励人们大胆创新。项目工作的一个基本准则就是，对代码库或文档的修改本身就是一种说明。提交记录中的变更不言自明。正因如此，所有变更都必须附带解释修改原因的注释或摘要。文档的版本控制就是元文档，它提供了\"为什么修改\"的背景信息。同样重要的是，所有项目成员都要关注这些变更。在论坛、错误报告或文档讨论页面对变更作出回应，能让讨论始终围绕原始修改点展开。 选择可扩展的开源工具 不要仅仅因为小团队最熟悉某些工具就选择它们。匆忙间为求快而草率决定也需谨慎。关于工具的选择，应与可信赖的社区领袖商讨后再做决定。尽可能明确治理规则 即便最终选择与其他社区成员步调不一致，至少你能清楚原因并做好风险应对准备。选用社区难以自主扩展的封闭工具存在风险。 确保每个人都能通过平等明确的途径，向开源工具提交写入权限 通过代码和内容的版本控制，你可以向更多人开放访问权限。例如，不必要求人们经历冗长的流程或用若干补丁来\"证明\"自己。赋予人们实现改变所需的任何权限，即使他们并未使用这些权限。维基百科就是绝佳范例——他们依靠社区规模的力量来监管不良内容修改，而非通过内容修改规则限制社区规模。愿意为项目贡献力量的人远多于蓄意破坏者。不要因少数人可能作恶而惩罚那些行善者。 尽可能清晰地制定治理规则 无论他们寻求什么，无论他们需要什么，你的贡献者社区都不希望面对令人困惑的治理架构。倾听反馈并修改文档，以推动表述方式和理解共识的演进——由此可能带来治理机制本身的进化，同时保持实现路径的透明度。 别让有害分子拖累社区 谨记宽容悖论：若无限度地宽容，你的宽容能力 终将被不宽容者剥夺或摧毁 [1] 。 寻求共识，投票作为最后手段 在开放社区中，大多数决策并非通过投票决定。正如运作良好的民主制度一样，决策由专家和知情人士处理，他们凭借周围人群的意愿行使职权。投票机制最适用于决定由谁掌权，以及偶尔出现的极具争议性问题。难道你不希望这些争议不存在吗？是否渴望能回到过去达成共识？","breadcrumbs":"衡量成功 » 定义健康社区 »

一个多元包容的组织更具创新力：它能从更多角度审视潜在问题，更自如地应对问题的复杂性，构想出更智能且多层次的解决方案，并察觉自身创造物中的偏见。这样的组织也更具抗风险能力：汇集多元视角意味着让更多经过独特训练的目光共同关注未来动向。虽然无法预知一个月、一年或五年后所有可能影响组织的变化，但汲取更广泛的见解意味着遭遇变革时能更敏捷坚韧。而贯穿整个组织的包容精神，能确保每个人在发现潜在威胁时既敢于发声又感到自在。 \"普遍包容精神\"对于 构建成员多样化的开源社区 至关重要。虽然行为准则对吸纳多元群体具有关键作用，但仅靠准则不足以建立多元化社区——因为它仅能约束 负面行为 ，并未明确要求领导者及其他项目成员应如何主动寻找被边缘化群体的代表。可采取的措施包括： 邀请代表性不足群体中可能受影响的成员加入领导层。被认定为\"少数群体\"的人往往会收到大量此类请求，且常因其他项目中自己的建议未被采纳而感到沮丧。因此邀请方必须能够说明项目的影响力，并提供证据表明他们的建议将得到认真对待。 请项目成员识别被排除群体的成员，邀请他们加入项目，或将其引荐给项目负责人。

根据社区目标的不同，可以建立各类衡量指标，例如工作积压情况、贡献者多样性（如组织背景、地域分布等）、首次贡献者流动率、本地化与国际化进展，或是讨论话题的热度。社区应当通过协作方式共同制定这些指标，并达成集体共识。听取来自不同背景社区成员的意见至关重要，这能确保指标具有包容性，而非仅聚焦于部分群体工作成果。

人们常倾向于用最容易衡量的指标来评估：这是人之常情，毕竟我们都想做更简单的事。但若社区仅关注易量化指标，就可能忽略社区的重要方面。例如，比起产出（如提交/合并请求的实际影响），投入（如提交/合并请求的数量）往往更易聚焦。不言而喻，忽视社区产出将导致对社区认知的片面性。 过度依赖指标会导致认识不完整：没有任何一套指标能全面反映社区（或任何组织）的真实状况。虽然建立标准化指标体系很重要，这样你才能评估社区随时间推移的进步，但总有些事物是极难衡量或量化的。例如，我们都希望贡献者能在社区中获得强烈的归属感，并享受与其他成员的协作。这种现象是否真实发生很难量化，但你仍然需要对这个关乎社区健康的关键维度有清晰把握——即便这意味着要采用指标收集之外的其他方法。 忽视内在动机：人们加入组织（特别是志愿组织）通常源于内在驱动力。例如，他们强烈认同团体使命，或享受与其他成员间的归属感。若在衡量标准中过度强调个人贡献（或投入），可能导致组织忽略人们最初加入的初衷。开源社区的大多数贡献者都是利用个人时间参与志愿工作的，因此忽视他们的内在动机往往会给社区带来负面影响。 关于内在动机的更多探讨，请参阅\"参与者动机\"章节。 除了这些指标常见的缺陷外，以下问题对开源社区尤为相关。 游戏化贡献指标：当社区主要以（甚至完全依赖）指标作为认可依据时，这种现象就会出现。毫不意外，你会看到人们为了一些微小的改动提交多次提交/合并请求/拉取请求，而这些改动本可以通过一次提交/合并请求/拉取请求完成。。 虚荣指标：在开源领域之外，你也常能看到这类现象。一个典型的例子就是过分关注社交媒体粉丝数量这类数据。正如在社交媒体中一样，数量并不能代表一切。此外，若想确保社区成员的内在动机得到满足，虚荣指标显然不是可取之道。 基于几个指标对不同开源社区进行比较时，你可能会听到这样的说法：\"项目 A 的上次大会有超过 5000 人参与\"，或者\"项目 B 拥有 1000 名贡献者\"，而人们对各自的社区抱有相似的期望。在将你的社区与他人对比之前，重要的是要考虑是否在进行同类比较（即苹果对苹果的比较）。你可能处于不同行业、项目成熟度阶段各异，或是范围不同等等，直接对比可能并不恰当。在考虑希望社区拥有 1000 名贡献者之前，或许应该先问一些基本问题，比如是否真的需要 1000 人来达成项目目标？ 过度聚焦代码贡献：可能是因为有更多工具能捕捉代码活动，但开源社区往往主要关注代码贡献。然而，必须记住其他有价值的贡献形式，比如在论坛回答问题、分类问题、维护维基页面等。应当努力确保社区指标能反映各类贡献（包括代码与非代码），这样社区中才不会有人感到被忽视。","breadcrumbs":"衡量成功 » 了解社区指标 »

善用指标识别异常情况：指标特别适合突显表现不佳的领域。与吞吐量相关的指标就是很好的例子，比如关闭问题所需时间、论坛帖子的响应速度、代码审核周期等。在这些场景中，指标能成为绝佳工具，帮助及早发现潜在的瓶颈。 以指标为起点，深入洞察社区健康状况：指标可以告诉你社区中正在发生什么，但通常仅凭数字无法揭示背后的原因。如果数据显示首次贡献者数量在下降，你可能需要进行一些面对面的走廊谈话或电话沟通，以找出下降的根源。指标能作为起点突出症状，但后续工作需要人们亲自推进。","breadcrumbs":"衡量成功 » 了解社区指标 »

招募领导者是开源社区建设的关键环节。作为项目负责人，你的成功很大程度上取决于培养和赋能更多项目领导者的能力（这些继任者又将延续这一传统，在项目中形成 指导者文化 ）。在物色这些角色的人选时，要关注那些提出深刻问题、为项目规划新方向或提出创新推广方式的成员，以及其他展现非正式领导者的特质。你可以通过两种方式与他们接触：直接描述空缺的领导岗位并询问其任职意愿；或是开启对话了解他们对项目的期待，进而鼓励他们通过承担领导职责来实现这些目标。 担任领导职务既需要时间投入，也意味着重大责任，但这是每个人都应把握的绝佳成长机会。以下是为项目领导角色人选提供的潜在激励方案： 他们在项目中实现所需变更的空间要广阔得多。 他们能更深入地理解项目的宗旨与影响力。 他们与项目领导者密切互动，这些领导者很可能是他们敬重甚至想要效仿的对象。。 他们掌握了项目管理与社区协作的新技能。 他们的专业能力与贡献获得社区内外的认可，由此带来更多人脉资源与职业发展机遇。 志愿者常问的第一个问题是：\"我需要投入多少时间？\"回答时不必强调该角色所需的时间投入。试着引导志愿者思考：如果他们成为领导者能为项目带来哪些益处，或是他们将获得的更高地位及其带来的好处（可能还包括对其组织的益处）。不妨大方赞美成员们的重要性——这完全属实！ 许多开源软件项目往往侧重于培养 技术

在提供数据时，务必结合适当的背景信息：即便对方提出的问题听起来很直接（例如“你们社区有多少贡献者？”），了解问题背后的背景往往大有裨益。提问者的身份不同，其实际关注点通常存在细微差异。例如，在某些情境下，项目历史上的贡献者总数可能是合适的答案，但在另一些情况下，提问者真正想了解的或许是一段时间内贡献者的增长情况。此外，“贡献者”具体指哪些人群？是否包含参与国际化、问题分类、活动策划等工作的人员？因此，在直接向他人展示数据之前，先理解其问题背后的背景乃至动机，将会更有助益。 忽略非量化指标：如前所述，并非所有事物都易于衡量或量化。即使我们拥有定义明确且完善的指标看板，也不应停止与社区成员保持人际沟通，以便及时掌握社区动态，并鼓励社区成员指出我们在指标中无法察觉的情况。","breadcrumbs":"衡量成功 » 了解社区指标 »

一旦发现违反社区规范的行为，应立即处理。理想情况下，若有成员违背良好行为准则，其他成员会礼貌指出，违规者也会改正自身行为。但若无人发声，或违规者因此挑起骂战（这可能耗尽团队精力，造成的损害甚至超过最初违规行为），此时便需要调解员介入。该调解员必须拥有执行规范的权限，必要时甚至可实施禁言处罚（此类情况应极为罕见）。 将调解员职责分散给多人看似诱人，但这样做存在风险。面对行为准则的模糊违规行为时，不同调解员可能作出相左的裁决，甚至引发内部骂战，造成极大破坏性。更理想的做法是每次只设一名调解员（若工作量过大可轮换人选），同时由社区指导委员会在不牵涉全体成员参与争论的前提下复核相关决定。 当行为准则被违反，威胁到社区成员的参与或可能降低讨论质量时，社区及负责监督讨论的版主首要任务是维护规范并消除威胁。这通常需要对冒犯性言论进行明确批评。然而，处理方式有多种选择，采用兼顾各方感受的方法往往能带来更理想的结果。 请记住，志愿者几乎总是怀着善意加入项目，其中许多人具备出色的技能可供贡献。冒犯性言论通常源于强烈情绪或无知。虽然必须表明不能容忍此类言论，但版主或指导者可以直接与发表言论者沟通，了解触发原因。通常情况下，可以通过引导让该成员继续留在社区，并学会更好的互动方式 为弥补冒犯性言论造成的伤害，领导者（最好还有其他社区成员）必须明确声明该言论越界。但发表该言论的人应在与领导者私下沟通后，主动道歉并承诺避免今后再有类似行为。若未能及时道歉，则可能需要对发表该言论者实施至少临时性封禁。 因此，违反行为准则的言论应分两个阶段处理。首先，领导者或版主必须声明该言论违反准则且不被允许。随后，领导者应私下联系发表该言论的人，了解其动机：是因情绪激动而口不择言？是蓄意挑衅或打压其他成员？还是确实未意识到言论具有冒犯性？在查明原因后，领导者应与当事人沟通，引导其学会如何在社区中发挥建设性作用。但若对方拒绝改正或坚持其\"权利\"继续违反准则，则可能面临封禁。","breadcrumbs":"马上开始

以用户为中心推进项目，同时保持社区开放，欢迎那些对软件开发过程产生好奇的用户，从而让你的软件大获成功。 因此，本指南的路径是： 吸引用户 使用你的软件，因为它能解决他们的问题；然后 引导参与者 ，尤其是那些关心开源和分享好的解决方案的参与者，使他们能够成为你软件的有效爱好者； 培养贡献者 从这个丰富且充满活力的用户和爱好者群体中，确保这些人在了解软件开发过程时，能够看到自己的影子并构想自己如何融入。确保当他们加入贡献者队伍时，障碍明显降低且氛围友好。 可以这样理解：让人们知道你举办了一场精彩的舞会是一回事；而让这些舞者主动宣扬你举办舞会的方式又是另一回事。最了不起的是，能让这场舞会不断进化，欢迎来自世界各地的各种音乐与舞蹈形式。 让看到海报并前来参与的舞者们留下来是第一步，如果他们能立刻感受到这里也是属于他们的天地，那将大有裨益。 你可以看到，这条通往项目成功的道路并不一定强调专业技能（甚至与项目相关的现有技能），而是更看重好奇心、愿意尝试软件、关心软件并帮助创造软件的意愿。这并不意味着人们不会为项目带来技能；事实上他们会的，许多人从第一次接触项目时就带来了技能。但比起教会某人真正关心你的项目，传授技能要容易得多。 在这段旅程中，我们推荐了许多最佳实践，包括如何制定衡量社区进展的计划。我们还列出了一些需要特别注意的具体领域，其中包含针对社区管理者自身心理健康与自我关怀的深入讨论。 我们更深入地传达所有这些信息的最佳方式是通过故事。除了章节正文中自然出现的故事外，本指南和 开源之道社区 中的其他领域汇集了这些关于\"为什么\"的故事。","breadcrumbs":"引言:呈现开源之道 »

举例来说，假设我们询问 Istio 开发者什么是 Istio。最基础的答案是\"这是个服务网格\"。但有人可能会反驳，大多数容器应用开发者并不完全理解\"服务网格\"的含义。因此这个简略描述——\"这是个服务网格！\"——并不能帮助新手判断是否需要使用或如何使用它。更好的解释可能是：用应用数据平面和控制平面来描述 Istio（如果对方来自网络领域），或是用\"分配给应用组件的交通警察\"这样的概念（如果向不了解服务网格的人解释该项目）。 根据社区需求提出尽可能多的后续问题，以形成对项目及其功能的简单直接理解。","breadcrumbs":"马上开始 » 设定目标 » 项目是什么？","id":"33","title":"项目是什么？"},"34":{"body":"许多开源项目并不清楚谁在使用他们的项目，以及这些用户如何利用项目工具。建议采用\"用户画像\"概念来刻画关键用户的典型群体，并确保从\"待完成的任务\"角度进行思考。 你可以通过多项标准对项目潜在或现有用户进行分类： 该项目对个人更有用，还是对组织更有用？ 你的项目是否在特定行业领域或商业场景中特别有用？ 什么规模的组织会觉得你的项目最有用？你的目标用户是大型企业的系统管理员，还是中小型企业？ 哪些人会下载、安装并使用你的项目？他们的职位头衔是什么？他们是同一批人吗？还是说用户与项目管理员不同？ 开源项目的下载安装者与商业产品的评估采购者之间存在怎样的关系？ 这些问题的答案将影响社区在项目架构、推广乃至特定功能开发投入力度上的优先级排序。例如，若项目运行于数据中心或服务器集群，目标用户通常是企业用户——专业从事 IT 运维的人员（或大学志愿者）。而对于移动应用或网页开发框架，多数用户会在个人电脑、工作站或手机上运行项目。不同用户群体对资源的需求各异，驱动他们使用项目及工具的痛点也各不相同。 此外，任何有意制定开源_产品_战略的人都应进一步思考项目_用户_和产品_买家_之间的关键关系。企业采用开源技术通常不会沿着\"直接使用上游开源项目→转向企业级开源产品\"的直线路径发展。开源采用往往是\"草根式\"自下而上推进；而企业级开源产品的评估采购则多呈现自上而下的特征。当企业内部采用某开源项目的人员能参与采购决策咨询——无论是因其与采购流程有直接联系，还是因为采购负责人知晓公司已在用该产品——这些人都可能成为极具价值的影响者。","breadcrumbs":"马上开始

确定应该将精力集中在何处可能很困难。因此，盘点当前与项目用户互动的所有方式非常有用，这有助于发现盲点和改进机会。不妨将互动方式划分为\"低接触\"、\"中接触\"和\"高接触\"（该术语借鉴自销售领域） 低接触 方式意味着潜在用户与社区之间极少互动，而 高接触 则代表一对一的深度交流或小范围互动。 以下是可以按此分类的典型方式示例： 低接触 ：网站、文档、在线培训、新闻通讯、播客、博客 中接触 ：邮件列表、缺陷追踪系统、社区论坛、会议演讲、网络研讨会、用户群组 高接触 ：电话沟通、一对一或小规模培训、会议交流、社区聚会 理想情况下，你的项目应均衡融合这些要素。完善网站、文档和宣传材料能让新用户自主操作，无需资深社区成员过多协助。通过缺陷追踪系统、邮件列表和论坛，社区成员可参与互动、提问并提供反馈，这类活动有助于深入了解用户如何使用你的项目。最后，培训课程、会议展台值守与跟进、面对面交流等高投入活动在一对一场景中极具价值——但这些方式的扩展性较为有限。 \"销售漏斗\"模型或许能为思考参与活动和项目目标的社区提供参考。 低接触活动非常适合提升项目知名度并吸引初次关注者。确保网站和其他材料清晰传达项目功能、如何帮助用户以及贡献者如何快速试用和上手至关重要。中接触活动能有效为项目打造\"引力中心\"——不仅实现与用户的沟通，还能促使用户间互助（有望产生网络效应）。而高接触活动则有利于与核心社区用户建立关系、收集社区案例研究，并帮助大型群体高效利用项目资源，最终成为项目倡导者。 团队在规划潜在参与路径时，一个关键考量是： 如何让不熟悉项目的人开始使用它 ，并随着时间的推移逐步提升在项目中的地位，最终成为核心贡献者。","breadcrumbs":"马上开始 » 设定目标 »

如果其他项目做着相同的工作但没有明确的领导者，他们处理问题的方式与你有何不同？ 如果你的项目存在开源竞争对手，加入他们（而非与之竞争）是否可行？如果不可行，原因何在？ 如果竞争对手已在市场中占据主导地位，你能了解到他们及其客户的哪些信息？ 你的竞争对手的客户是谁？他们有什么共同点？ 人们使用竞争项目的动机是什么？ 分析竞争对手能帮助你在项目目标设定初期回答若干关键问题，而解答这些问题将为社区后续确定功能优先级和制定潜在用户触达策略提供依据。例如，你可以借力竞争对手技术爱好者现有的聚会活动，在这些场合传播你的理念。若你属于颠覆式创新者，你的目标与宣传话术可能需要围绕竞品展开：\"比 XX 更便宜\"、\"XX 的开源替代方案\"、\"比 XX

其他条件不变时，商品价格下降会带动其互补品需求上升。 每个成功的商业开源战略都基于这一原则。若你的目标是营收，则需要确定与开源软件配套的增值服务，这些配套服务应为客户提供额外价值。 制定开源战略时，你的目标是将这些原则与具体的商业目标相衔接。","breadcrumbs":"马上开始 » 制定开源产品战略 »

首先是规模效应：潜在人群基数越大，对项目产生兴趣并最终成为贡献者的人数就越多。人群多样性程度越高，这个基数就能扩展得越大。举例而言，若项目中仅让男性感到受欢迎，就意味着你将潜在用户/贡献者规模限制在了不到全球人口半数范围内。 专家级贡献者很少会突然出现并准备好立即投入贡献。更多人会先成为软件用户，继而参与更广泛的用户社区，最终成为初级贡献者，沿着这条路径逐步成长。经过或短或长的时间后，他们的专业能力会在社区中得到认可。开启这条路径的人越多，最终走完全程的人也就越多。 多样性与沟通同样是项目的首要课题。沟通对于向世界传达软件的功能及其使用价值至关重要，同时也能通过有效渠道收集用户反馈。多样性与包容性是为创新、适应力和长期可持续发展注入力量的目标。如果你的社区不能反映这个世界的多样性，它就无法在这个世界长久存续。 可以这样理解：当人们首次访问你的网站时，就应该立即看到社区拥有正式的《行为准则》和多元化的领导团队。那些最需要在社区中找到归属感的人——那些需要确认自己在加入后身心安全的人——往往在初次浏览项目网站时就会判断这个社区是否足够包容。如果这些文化元素没有直观呈现，这些潜在成员在考虑成为协作者或贡献者之前就会悄然离开。 本节包含以下章节： 帮助你理解一个旨在培育用户与贡献者社区的开源项目应具备的基本要素

曾是了解新项目发布或现有项目更新的主要平台，而功能设计和项目改进的讨论则通过电子邮件展开，并归档在项目的邮件列表存档中。 如今，这一格局已发生多方面的转变。 尽管实时聊天在当前或许不如往日普遍，但项目并未完全放弃这种形式。许多项目转而采用被认为更友好或更易接入的服务，例如 Matrix、Slack、RocketChat 等。有些项目甚至会使用桥接工具兼容旧版聊天系统（如 IRC），以帮助社区逐步过渡到包含新型服务的生态中。 部分社区仍采用电子邮件进行异步沟通，而另一些社区则发现通过提供在线论坛协作机会能取得更好效果——这种形式对许多开发者而言更为熟悉，他们最初编程时恰逢 Reddit 和 Imgur 等新兴热门论坛兴起，习惯于在此类平台分享资讯与观点。论坛支持者认为其视觉布局更具吸引力，管理员也偏好该媒介精细的权限控制功能，这些功能使内容管理更为便捷（例如在激烈讨论中暂停特定主题下的所有发帖，通过多数论坛软件即可轻松实现——邮件列表则难以做到这点）。 虽然像 Freshcode 等网站延续了早期精神，自由开源软件项目也广泛利用 X 和 Facebook 等社交媒体服务与用户及开发者群体互动。社交媒体是项目推广的绝佳渠道，能帮助受众及时了解重大项目进展。 社交媒体还具备以下功能： 宣传即将举行的活动 内容或演讲的直播 激发对项目的兴趣 超越项目简报、网站或博客范围的其他营销与推广形式 许多用户现在期望通过这些平台获得基础技术支持 虽然邮件列表存档可能不再作为项目讨论的权威记录，但 GitHub 作为在线开发和协作平台的流行，意味着许多项目现在通过

上详尽的README.md文件完全可以充当项目网站，只要其提供的信息能让用户和潜在贡献者对项目有充分了解。基础项目网站至少应包含以下部分。 项目概述 在项目网站的显眼位置简要概述项目内容。项目描述应包含代码库的设计用途以及使用者可能解决的问题。确保这些信息简洁明了且易于查找至关重要。在项目主页发布简短说明，让感兴趣的人能立即判断该项目是否符合其需求。 请将这段信息视为向从未听说过你项目的人解释它为何重要的机会——用 30 秒或更短时间。例如，Drupal 的 简介页面 是这样描述该项目的： Drupal 是内容管理软件。你日常使用的许多网站和应用程序都由它构建而成。Drupal 具备出色的标准功能，例如便捷的内容创作、可靠的性能以及卓越的安全性。但使其与众不同的是其灵活性——模块化设计正是其核心理念之一。其工具能帮助你构建动态网络 体验所需 [2] 的多样化、结构化内容。 在这段简短的描述中，我们了解到： Drupal 是什么（一种内容管理系统）。 什么是内容管理系统（用于构建网站的工具）。 为什么 Drupal 是一个引人注目的选择（易于使用、可靠、安全且灵活）。 让我们再看一个流行项目的例子：Kubernetes。 当访问项目主页 kubernetes.io 时，访客立即看到以下说明： Kubernetes（K8s）是一个用于自动化部署、扩展和管理容器化应用程序的开源系统。它将构成应用程序的容器分组为逻辑单元，便于管理和发现。Kubernetes 基于 Google 15 年生产环境工作负载的运行经验，并结合了来自 社区的 [3] 最佳创意和实践。 在这个描述中，我们可以立即了解到： Kubernetes 是什么。（它是一个用于管理容器化应用程序的系统，涵盖部署、扩展和管理功能。） Kubernetes 的缩写规则。（这类细节能迅速提升新成员的熟悉度——没有人会被要求事先掌握晦涩的缩写。） Kubernetes 的诞生地。（谷歌被标注为该代码库的创始者，表明该项目专注于企业级应用，并确保软件设计精良且维护良好。） Kubernetes 是开源的。（用户可以自由使用、运行、修改及共享代码变更；任何关于许可费用、采购流程等准入门槛的疑虑都不复存在。） 本项目重视社区参与。（可以预期，代码、文档等贡献是受欢迎且受鼓励的。） 快速入门 编写优秀\"入门\"文档（有时称为\"上手文档\"）的流程不在本章讨论范围内。（详见本指南专设的\"新手指引\"章节。）此处只需明确：开源项目网站应设立专门板块，帮助新用户和潜在贡献者开始使用软件。将该板块清晰标注为\"入门指南\"或\"新用户\"能让人在需要时轻松找到。若能在新手指引文档中进一步区分\"新用户\"与\"新贡献者\"则更为理想，因为这两个群体的需求差异显著。在项目网站上为新人明确指引这些资源，有助于避免论坛和实时聊天室等沟通渠道反复出现\"如何上手\"的重复提问。 {% hint style=\"success\" %} 在项目的新手入门指南中，为初次接触项目的用户和参与者提供所有能获取帮助的渠道信息。例如：可以设置名为\"新手区\"的 Slack 频道，由乐于指导新人上手的成员提供支持；而持续性的开发讨论则可在\"开发者\"频道进行。 {% endhint %} 常见问题 展示项目基本信息的另一绝佳位置是常见问题解答（FAQ）页面。若项目开发尚处初期阶段，只需准备基础 FAQ，说明项目内容、代码库用途以及如何获取代码即可。但随着更多参与者加入——包括新用户、开发人员、文档编写者等——你可能会发现自己反复回答相同的基础问题。（在这个过程中，你还会发现项目的许多方面对新人而言并不像你认为的那样显而易见。）这些重复性问题正是完善文档和向社区寻求帮助的良机。 保持 FAQ 内容更新且易于查找。但更好的做法是：邀请社区成员协助完善它。无论是通过项目邮件列表回复邮件，还是在实时聊天中解答新人的疑问时，都可以请提问者将问题与答案整理成文，纳入项目 FAQ。通过向社区寻求帮助，你能实现多重效果： 协助你保持文档内容的相关性和时效性。 展现对社区贡献的欢迎与鼓励。 主动邀请已表现出项目兴趣的人进一步参与，寻求他们的帮助。 理想情况下，新手应能自行编辑 FAQ 文档。在请求对方贡献 FAQ 内容时，附上编辑指南可显著降低参与门槛，从而提高贡献接收率。若项目设有贡献者名单，务必将 FAQ 贡献者列入其中。人们乐于看到自己的劳动成果（无论多微小）获得认可。这种认可能赋予贡献者归属感与项目忠诚度。当人们感到自己的付出受到重视，便更可能长期留存，通过提交问题或开发新功能等方式持续为项目贡献力量。 记录项目目标和非目标 项目网站应当清晰阐明该项目的宗旨及核心活动内容。若访客不了解当前进行中的工作与未来规划，将难以找准自身在社区中的定位，也无法明确可以贡献哪些力量。 项目路线图是传达这些目标的常用工具。即便当前资源不足以制定完整路线图，仍需设法让用户和潜在贡献者了解项目全貌。例如，通过简短的博客或论坛帖子发布每周项目进展回顾及未来周/月计划就是个良好开端。这类内容既能帮助新人快速熟悉项目，也可作为意向参与者入门引导的优质参考资料。 阐明项目的非目标同样重要。由于开源项目充满活力的特性，自然会有人发现项目创建者未曾设想的用途，并希望扩展项目功能以满足特定用例。如果项目维护者无意扩大项目现有范围，提前告知潜在贡献者这一立场，将为所有人节省时间和避免失望。在这个 轻松分叉 的时代，那些只想使用项目部分功能的人可以相对容易地开发和维护更符合自身需求的代码库——完全无需要求原项目维护者偏离既定愿景和已规划的项目范畴。 对于商业导向的项目而言，记录非目标同样至关重要。当贡献者希望以开源方式开发某项功能时，这可能与厂商开发专有特性的目标产生冲突。贡献者仍可选择以开源形式实现该功能，但他们应当从一开始就知晓上游维护者无意将其成果纳入项目代码库。有些人得知厂商正在开发该功能后，可能选择放弃实现；另一些人若知晓该功能不会被纳入项目主干源代码树，也可能选择放弃——因为他们不愿独自承担持续的维护负担。当然，也有人会继续开发符合自身需求的解决方案，并以开源形式发布，无论该功能最终是否被纳入项目的主源码库。 最重要的是，不要让任何人对项目的发展方向感到_意外_。虽然项目不必接受所有贡献，但如果贡献者投入时间和精力开发的内容因与未知路线图（商业或其他方面）冲突而被拒绝，这会在社区中制造紧张气氛，并导致项目维护者失去信任。甚至可能促使人们转而采用该供应商产品的开源替代方案。","breadcrumbs":"吸引用户 » 开源项目中的沟通规范 »

入门指南","id":"6","title":"入门指南"},"60":{"body":"本节详细介绍了如何将问题追踪器作为核心沟通工具使用。 什么是问题跟踪器？ 问题跟踪器 （issue tracker）（有时也称为_错误跟踪器_、 问题列表_或_问题队列 ）是一种工具，当用户认为软件 运行不符合预期 [4] 时，可通过该工具提交问题报告。作为一种监控待办事项并支持对进行中的工作展开协作评论与审查的方式，部分项目会通过问题追踪器来管理整个开发流程。 本节将讨论如何使用问题追踪器来报告软件故障。通过项目的问题追踪器提交问题，你可以确保负责维护的人员看到你的报告并采取相应措施。 为什么要提交问题？ 虽然提交问题可能比在实时聊天中直接求助更繁琐，但这样做有几点重要原因： 项目贡献者无法追踪所有跨平台对话，但他们始终可以参考问题跟踪器来改进项目。 实时聊天和社交媒体是即时性沟通渠道。问题追踪器则是专为记录和审查软件问题而构建的工具。软件项目通常通过将问题追踪器作为核心组件（甚至可能是唯一工具）来定义其近期工作计划，从而对所有待处理事项进行优先级排序。（简而言之，项目的问题追踪器往往等同于项目的待办事项清单。）如果你的问题未被录入问题追踪器，它很可能因忙碌者遗忘细节而无法得到解决。正因如此，当你寻求帮助时，往往会首先被要求提交问题报告，以便项目维护者能够持续跟踪该问题。 提交问题能让你与项目贡献者就问题进行异步沟通，因为各方都可以随时查阅问题描述及后续评论。 当你发现软件存在问题时，可能会意识到该问题实际上是_另一个_问题的根本原因，或者存在_多个_问题相互关联的情况。问题追踪软件允许项目开发者将相关问题归类，这有助于诊断问题的根源。 用户在使用软件时常常会遇到相同的问题，其中许多人会向项目提交问题报告。对于项目维护者来说，处理大量重复问题的报告会耗费大量时间，因为他们需要对每位报告者分别反馈处理进展。幸运的是，问题追踪系统能有效简化这一流程——维护者可以快速关闭重复问题（注明该问题与现有问题重复），并指引问题报告者前往\"原始\"报告跟进处理进度。 项目维护者随后可在一处向所有遇到该问题的人员进行广播式沟通，既简化了工作流程，又能为所有需要帮助的人提供支持。 确保问题追踪器易于查找 确保在项目的常见问题解答（FAQ）、使用文档和开发文档中显著显示问题追踪器的位置。如果用户无法确定在哪里提交问题，他们会向项目人员询问。对于这类基础问题反复提供答案来支持热心用户可能会相当耗时。 为你的社区和自己行个方便，让问题追踪系统一目了然。 使用问题模板 并非所有使用你软件的人都熟悉你社区提交有效错误报告的惯例。为了节省你和错误报告者的时间，提供一个问题模板以确保你获得重现所报告错误及有效分类所需的信息。例如，你可能需要了解错误发生时使用的软件版本或操作系统。如果需要重现错误的常见信息，请在问题模板中要求提供这些内容。 问题模板中的常见字段包括问题摘要、重现步骤、用户观察到的实际行为、软件的预期行为，以及请求提供日志文件或截图以帮助问题审核者更好地理解错误报告。多个问题追踪系统支持错误报告模板，包括 GitHub 、 GitLab 、 Redmine 和 Trac 。 如果你发现自己针对不同的错误报告反复询问相同的信息，那么恭喜你。你已经发现了模板中需要改进的部分。 寻求帮助：标记问题以提高清晰度并鼓励贡献 现代大多数问题跟踪系统都允许用户为提交的问题添加标签，这有助于项目工作的组织管理。通过区分不同类型的请求——如开发新功能、软件缺陷等——项目维护者能够更有条理地处理问题，提高分类效率。此外，许多有意参与开源软件项目的贡献者会通过查看问题列表来寻找适合自己参与的任务，从而更好地理解项目的开发机制。若计划在问题跟踪系统中积极使用标签，请务必在开发文档中明确标注各标签的定义，以确保标签使用的一致性（或仅限项目维护者添加问题标签）。一套使用混乱的标签体系，其作用与未分类的问题列表并无二致。 将问题标记为“新手友好”或“寻求帮助”可以让项目维护者特别标注出适合新加入贡献者处理的问题。这种标记方式表明项目已准备好接纳新贡献者，且维护者欢迎社区在特定领域提供协助。不要害怕针对项目文档、网站或任何你认为有问题的地方提交问题。如果存在当前或潜在贡献者可以帮助改进项目的地方，就在问题跟踪器中提交这些问题，并贴上清晰的标签，让他们知道自己可以参与贡献。 只需_明确_说明（可以在“需要帮助”的问题文本中或通过链接到其他项目文档）你希望他人在处理此类问题时如何参与项目。（ Apache Subversion问题页面 就是一个很好的例子，它在用户提交问题前就清晰地阐明了需求。）最好鼓励处理这些问题的贡献者在过程中与项目维护者保持沟通，这样他们的贡献更有可能被项目采纳。没有什么比贡献者带着现成的解决方案出现，却被告知他们的具体实现不符合项目需求更能打击热情的了。 清晰友善地沟通 无论你是报告问题的项目使用者，还是审查拉取请求的项目维护者，_清晰友善地_沟通问题始终至关重要。当工具无法正常工作时，使用者可能会感到沮丧。同样，将项目开发作为业余爱好的人，也不太可能对要求他们花时间解决与自己无关的问题作出积极回应。请记住在与项目其他参与者讨论时保持礼貌和感激，因为每个分享知识的人都在为项目的整体健康发展贡献力量。 当问题成为激烈辩论的焦点 有时，解决特定问题的细节可能会在社区内引发紧张或争论。 在任何蓬勃发展的项目中——无论是软件还是其他领域——健康且相互尊重的辩论都是不可或缺的一部分，但情绪很容易升温，而且（ 正如大量记录所显示的 [5] ）人们在网络上的行为往往不如面对面时那么文明。 若某个问题引发激烈争议且讨论变得粗鲁或煽动性，可限制该问题的访问权限一段时间（例如 24 至 48 小时），让人们有时间冷静思考，以更平和、建设性的方式阐述观点。 提交问题的快速提示 感谢那些投入时间和精力开发软件的人们，特别是当你刚接触这个项目时。这些利用（业余）时间为你创造免费开源软件的个体，同样渴望知道自己的时间被珍视、劳动成果被认可。 尽可能详细地提供你遇到的错误信息。如果项目使用了问题模板，请尽可能完整地填写模板内容。 若你无法提供所需信息或不确定如何自行获取，只需注明你已尝试过哪些方法。这些细节有助于维护者判断他们需要采取哪些措施来协助你。 如果项目没有使用问题（issue）模板，可以查看其他已\"关闭-已修复\"的问题或已合并的拉取请求，了解他人是如何提交错误报告的。若该问题已被修复，那么这些历史记录很可能就能作为重现错误所需信息类型的范例。按照这些报告中的内容进行复现，并尽可能补充更多细节。 快速响应问题的技巧 “虽然开发社区的规模和技能限制了问题单的处理速度，但项目至少应在问题单出现时立即予以确认。即使问题单会滞留一段时间，及时回应也能鼓励提交者保持参与，因为她能感受到自己的付出已被人工记录（请记住，提交问题单通常比发送电子邮件需要更多精力）。” — Karl Fogel，《Producing Open Source Software》 [6] 感谢提交者提出问题。帮助项目改进是对项目健康的卓越贡献。此外，通过保持亲切、友善和热情的态度，你将鼓励问题报告者持续参与和贡献。 当以“不予修复”关闭问题时，需说明不予修复的原因。维护者无需被迫接受每一个拉取请求或修复所有报告的问题，但至少应告知问题提交者_为何_某些问题不会被处理。 特别是当有人提交了问题报告及修复代码或新功能实现时，务必向其说明为何其工作成果未被项目采纳。若不作解释，贡献者会感到自己的时间被浪费，进而将精力转向其他软件项目。理想情况下，你应当附上已发布的项目路线图链接，阐明该提交为何不符合项目需求。（参见上文说明。） 对于新贡献者提交的内容，你可以自行修复补丁中的小问题，并附上说明解释修复内容和原因。因细微瑕疵而拒绝补丁会打击贡献积极性，且解释拒绝原因所花的时间往往与进行微小修复相当。这类解释是引导贡献者查阅项目其他资源（如代码风格指南、沟通规范文档等）的绝佳时机。 对于响应\"求助\"问题提交的内容，需尽早且频繁地与表示有兴趣处理该问题的人员进行沟通。这样做能确保贡献者的提交真正符合项目需求。此外，通过保持对新贡献者的可及性和定期对话，你将与他们建立一种促进相互学习的关系，并增加他们持续参与项目后续工作的可能性。 在问题跟踪系统中进行开发讨论和其他对话 开源软件开发早期的传统观点认为，社区_不应_在项目的问题跟踪器中进行开发相关讨论。项目社区更倾向于通过邮件列表或论坛开展此类对话，原因包括： 订阅邮件列表的人员无需解析问题跟踪器内容即可发表评论并表达观点和需求 论坛或邮件列表对话被认为更适合异步和长篇交流，而 1990 年代至 2000 年代初流行的问题跟踪工具并不适合开展实质性讨论 要查明某项技术决策的具体原因十分困难，因为这些细节往往埋没在问题追踪系统中，尤其当决策完成后相关问题会被标记为\"已关闭\"状态。在已关闭的问题中寻找项目技术方向的解释，这种操作方式本身就违背常理。 随着 GitHub 作为一站式在线开发平台的兴起，项目问题追踪器中的讨论已成为主流。GitHub 的问题系统在视觉上复现了论坛软件常见的界面形态，这让在其系统中进行的讨论对成长于网络论坛兴起时代的开发者而言显得尤为自然。此外，当所有基础设施都能通过单一工具管理时，维护 Mailman 实例或额外论坛软件所需的时间和资源就变得冗余。新增功能如对问题\"+1\"表态、设置特定问题的精细化通知控制、以及锁定问题仅允许项目维护者编辑（同时保持他人可见）等特性，使得转向问题追踪器进行讨论的方案更易被接受且高效。 然而，项目外部人士也应能跟进讨论内容。只有极少数深度投入的参与者会严格追踪每个问题更新，这使得临时贡献者难以参与项目。虽然在线问题追踪系统强大的搜索功能让查找已关闭问题更为便捷，但问题讨论的流程并不能替代对具体实施方案的叙述性说明，或对某项决策原因的阐释。还需注意的是，那些对项目最为熟悉（能轻易回忆起特定讨论对应问题编号）的维护者们，并非总能随时协助项目工作。 以易于访问的方式保存有关决策的知识： 为致力于探究项目流程背后原因的人们节省时间。 节省维护者的时间，使他们无需定期重复讲解历史背景。 确保即使项目成员发生变化，关键决策的制定方式及原因也始终清晰可查。 {% hint style=\"success\" %} 如果项目的大部分开发讨论都在问题跟踪器中进行，可以考虑采取一些小措施，以更易于相关方和广大受众发现和获取的方式，在其他渠道突出展示这些讨论。 {% endhint %} 例如，你可以在博客、论坛帖子或项目通讯中总结该问题的讨论，这样既能保存项目的文化传承，又能向更广泛的社区通报变更。如果项目没有维护博客或其他适合此类沟通的发布机制，可以考虑在项目文档中添加关键问题列表，以便新人能快速了解这些重要主题，同时也便于长期项目参与者随时查阅。","breadcrumbs":"吸引用户 » 开源项目中的沟通规范 »

种语言的世界里，但由于历史原因，互联网交流——以及主要开源项目中使用的主要语言仍是英语。对于非英语母语用户和贡献者而言，这一事实会形成显著的参与障碍。项目方可以采取若干措施来帮助非英语母语者更有效地参与项目。 显著标注多语言社区资源 如果你的项目被广泛采用并发展到拥有多种语言交流渠道的程度，请确保在项目网站上显著列出这些资源。在项目网站上注明：项目欢迎社区成员提交非英语撰写的资源。当项目收到此类提交时，请及时将其纳入项目文档中。 正如你向社区推荐任何资源时一样，请尽力确保该资源具有实用性。若项目当前可用人力无法验证资源的价值，请说明项目维护者尚未能亲自评估该资源的情况，同时表明欢迎社区对其纳入项目文档提出反馈意见。 无论英语水平如何 都应友善相待 正如本章多次强调的那样，与所有项目参与者保持友善、得体的沟通应成为互动的默认行为准则。当与那些用英语表达存在困难的人交流时，同样需要遵循这一原则。如果难以理解对方的表述或需求，应通过提问澄清来表明你乐意提供帮助。切勿仅因对方书面英语水平有限就忽视其存在，或宣称其在项目中不受欢迎。 {% hint style=\"success\" %} 非英语母语者在与项目沟通时，常会因英语水平欠佳而先致歉。收到此类信息时，请感谢对方的来信，并表达对其努力与项目沟通的赞赏。如有可能，可引导他们获取更熟悉的语言资源，例如项目的西班牙语论坛或中文邮件列表。 {% endhint %} 在书面文档中避免使用习语 每种语言都包含一些字面意思与实际含义不符的短语，比如用\"over the moon\"表示极度开心，或用\"raining cats and dogs\"形容倾盆大雨。对特定文化背景的人而言，这些短语的含义显而易见。但缺乏相关语境的人可能会感到困惑。为确保文档对所有读者都清晰易懂，请使用平实的语言替代习语表达。 展开缩略词并提供术语表 虽然缩略词能让熟悉某领域的人省时省力，免去输入或说出完整短语的麻烦，但它们却会让不熟悉该领域的人感到困惑。此外，缩略词往往存在多义性，即同一个缩略词在不同领域可能对应不同的全称。例如，刚接触某个项目的新人可能不明白\"LGTM\"表示\"looks good to me\"（我看没问题），因此也不知道他们的工作成果已获准合并到项目源码库中。如果项目中经常使用特定缩略词进行沟通，建议花时间编写这些术语的速查表。维护这份术语表也是志愿者快速参与贡献的便捷方式。 积极寻求本地化志愿者的参与 正如本章前面提到的，项目维护者应当始终明确他们希望从社区获得何种帮助。文档资源的本地化就是一个关键的需求领域。无论社区成员的软件开发技能水平如何，他们都可以通过翻译文档来积极推动项目发展并提升质量，从而使项目能够触达更多人群和潜在贡献者。维护者应当明确表达招募专注于本地化工作的贡献者的意愿。","breadcrumbs":"吸引用户 » 开源项目中的沟通规范 »

正如本章通篇所讨论的，保持友善与得体的沟通对项目的持续健康发展至关重要。虽然人们可能自然而然地认为每个人都理解\"友善与得体的沟通\"是什么样子，但我们不能假定所有参与者对此有一致的理解，尤其是在面对全球受众时。项目维护者和社区成员以身作则固然重要，但明确阐述何为文明讨论、哪些内容与项目无关、以及项目对沟通者（尤其是涉及可能引发争议的事项时）的期望，能为项目设定恰当的基调。 摘录自

项目的《多样性声明》，堪称记录项目沟通规范的绝佳范例。它明确表示无论个人背景、技术水平或使用项目的侧重点如何，所有人都能在此项目中受到欢迎。声明清晰地指出犯错在所难免，并期望人们将这些不完美视为学习机会，而非贬低他人的借口。该声明告知用户及潜在贡献者：他们或许无法总是从项目维护者那里获得想要的东西，但错误会被修正，合理请求即使未被采纳也会得到倾听。尤为可贵的是，它列出的是一系列预期的_亲社会行为_，而非简单的_禁止事项_清单。声明将项目维护者和社区成员示范的行为，从具体行动转化为文字表述，帮助所有人理解哪些行为构成了优秀的项目公民素养。 制定项目社会契约 当项目记录其社区沟通规范时，制定项目社会契约可能特别有效。项目社会契约明确了项目期望所有参与者展现的行为，并设定了项目成员对他人负责的标准。这份契约本质上并非禁止行为清单，而是关于项目成员如何选择自我管理以实现共同成功的宣言。通过对话制定社会契约的过程，成员间建立起相互理解，为未来对话奠定基础。 你可以在 开放实践库 中了解更多关于创建社会契约的信息，包括为远程团队制定契约的技巧。 行为准则 一些项目采用行为准则来记录他们对文明讨论的期望。寻求外部贡献的开源项目都应制定行为准则。对于举办线上或线下活动的项目而言，为活动制定专门的行为准则也是最佳实践。不妨将行为准则视为项目社会契约的一部分——它既包含社区自治的规则，也明确了每位成员如何在可能采取不同行动以获得更好结果时彼此问责。这些规则必须被明确理解和阐述，否则人们既不知道对他们的期望，也无法判断这个项目是否值得投入时间和专业知识。

做好功课，并告诉大家你已经做了功课 。如果使用开源软件时遇到问题，请先尽力自行解决。无法解决问题并不丢人，这反而有助于完善你的错误报告。在提交错误报告或通过项目沟通渠道寻求帮助时，务必注明你已采取的解决步骤。这样做能节省他人的时间和精力，因为维护者不会要求你重复已经尝试过的方案。列出你已尝试的自助方法，是对项目维护者时间与精力的尊重。 遵循 基本的网络礼仪 。互联网交流中最基本的建议同样适用于开源项目和社区。例如，避免全用大写字母输入，因为这种形式会被视为咆哮（而没有人会通过咆哮来求助）。选择一个合理且易于接近的用户名或昵称，否则你可能无法被他人认真对待。在尝试通过其他沟通渠道获取回应前，请给予合理的时间（比如 24 到 48 小时）等待对你的询问的回复。如果你不熟悉网络交流的基本规则，弗吉尼亚·希亚（Virgina Shea）常被引用的 《网络礼仪核心规则》 可能是一个有用的资源。 在合适的地方发布问题和交流信息 。人们在不预期的地方遇到信息会感到困扰。例如，使用项目的问题跟踪器来通知大家下周要举办黑客松就不合适。如果项目已经花时间告知贡献者提问的方式和渠道——你应该通过遵循本清单第一条的指引了解这点——请务必使用恰当的论坛进行交流。这表明你投入了时间和精力，按照项目维护者和其他志愿者要求的方式与他们互动，体现出你尊重他们的付出，进而让他们更易于帮助你取得成功。 尽量让帖子标题富有意义 。在撰写邮件或论坛帖子的标题时，要明确表达需求。例如，标题为\"我想我发现了一个漏洞\"的帖子，其处理速度很可能比\"升级至 2.2 版本后外接显示器无法识别\"慢得多。第二个标题向读者表明，他们很可能会找到更多关于如何诊断问题的细节，同时表明发帖者理解读者时间和注意力的有限性。第一个标题则完全无法区分发帖者的问题，使得你的沟通难以给读者留下印象。帖子标题越有用，你就越有可能获得及时回复。 在任何交流中都要保持友善与礼貌 。再次强调，无论开源软件还是其他项目，有效沟通的关键在于体贴和得体的行为。不要怒气冲冲地出现在开源项目中，强硬地要求解决你的问题；没有得到即时回复时，别发送不礼貌的催促信息；也不要对交流对象表现出任何不友善的态度。务必花时间感谢他们提供的帮助，以及为所有人贡献的这个项目。请记住，你是在和他人沟通，其中有些人正利用业余时间为你编写免费软件。以你希望获得的尊重与礼遇对待他们。","breadcrumbs":"吸引用户

乍看之下，开源似乎不受困扰科技公司的多元化和包容性问题的多重影响。开源生态系统在线运作；贡献者跨越国家、语言和时区协作，推动技术进步。在某些情况下，人们纯粹出于对这些项目的热爱而贡献，而非为了免费啤酒和股票。鉴于这种利他意图的普遍性，人们认为开源是真正的精英制度，一个无论代词或肤色如何，所有人都能蓬勃发展的空间。但如果行业倡导者有什么比精英制度更热衷的，那就是数据。而当数据显示谁在贡献开源生态系统时，它描绘了一幅令人不安的画面。 本章概述了多个开源社区为提升项目多样性与包容性所做的努力，同时为开源社区管理者和项目维护者提供了初步实践步骤，帮助构建能够受益于多元化贡献者群体的社区与项目。最关键的是，文章强调开源社区必须在寻找代表性不足群体的贡献者之前先践行包容性。若不尝试消除阻碍参与者留存的系统性障碍，多元化努力将始终徒劳无功。","breadcrumbs":"吸引用户 » 构建多元化的开源社区：以确保社区具有包容性为首 »

正如本次调查所示，美国科技行业的管理者以白人和/或男性为主。开源社区中白人和/或男性贡献者的比例甚至更高。2017 年 GitHub 对 6000 名开源用户和开发者的 调查 显示，随机抽样的受访者中 95%为男性，3%为女性，1%为非二元性别者。 为何这种情况仍在持续？近年来涌现了大量多元化和包容性（D&I）计划，旨在招募更多元化的项目贡献者。Linux 基金会在其开源峰会上专门设置了 D&I 主题议程；DrupalCon 为来自弱势群体的参会者和演讲者提供奖学金；2019 年 All Things Open 大会多个主论坛主题演讲都探讨了多元化问题。在社区领袖如此重视的情况下，为何贡献者数据仍呈现如此严峻的局面？ 起初，女性和弱势少数群体（URMs）在开源活动中的相对缺席似乎令人惊讶，但深入观察后会发现开源社区在包容性方面存在一些根深蒂固的问题。包容性常被当作多样性的同义词，实则它自成原则。引用梅格·博尔格的观点：\"包容性是指不同身份个体在特定环境（如团队、职场或行业）中感到或被重视、能力得到发挥并受到欢迎。\"正是某些长期存在的系统性障碍，阻碍了女性和弱势少数群体融入开源社区。若不解决这些系统性问题，开源领域的多样性将难以改善。

对此我深有体会。两年前在温哥华开源峰会演讲后，我被这个热情包容的社区深深打动，决心寻找能贡献力量的项目。凭借多年跨领域写作经验，我认为文档编写是最理想的切入点。但当我注册首个 GitHub 账号登录平台后，面对完全陌生的操作界面，那种茫然无措至今记忆犹新。由于不懂代码分支、合并请求等基本操作，我既找不到入门路径，更清楚犯错成本极高。 我很幸运生活在一个科技社区活跃的城市，这里定期举办面向各类技术爱好者的线下聚会，包括针对初学者的教程。我人生中的首次 pull request 就是在一次技术会议上当面完成的，随后几十次 GitHub 贡献也大多诞生于线下活动。直到参加了数月免费且门槛亲民的交流活动后，我才开始独立参与开源贡献。若没有这些便利条件，我绝不会独自耗费数小时研究 GitHub 操作流程，只为提交一个可能被接纳也可能被拒绝的 PR。 同一份 GitHub 调查显示，五分之一的开源贡献者因不良行为退出项目，同时也指出不完整或混乱的文档是最大的挑战。93%的受访者表示遇到过这个问题，然而 60%的人表示很少或从未参与过文档贡献。其结果就是，项目老手也难读懂自己项目的文档。 试想这会让圈外人作何感受。 \"参与开源不仅是技术挑战，同样也是社交挑战，\"GitLab

时常创造学习机会，寻找方法帮助他人了解你的工作内容与方式。不要仅等待正式的实习或指导者计划，但若有机会务必善加利用。可以考虑录制视频、举办问答活动、参与行业会议等。主动开展非正式交流以建立人际关系与信任，从而发掘具备潜力的人才。广泛撒网，你很可能会发现那些愿意挺身而出的宝贵贡献者，他们将助力你的项目迈向全新高度。 成为连接枢纽。在脑海中绘制社区核心贡献者的能力地图，通过引荐新人给多位指导者实现资源共享。指导者精疲力竭的情况真实存在，需确保学习者在你无暇顾及时有其他求助对象。 确保有一个专门用于社群互动的聊天工具。为了建立信任，人们需要私人空间。聊天能促进对话与协作，也允许他人直接给你发消息。为了避免倦怠，你可能需要准备两个聊天工具——一个专用于社群/工作交流，另一个仅用于个人生活。这样，当你需要休息时，可以关闭其中一个工具的所有通知，或者单纯借助用户体验的差异来实现心理区隔。 通过活动建立连接。活动为你与潜在学习者搭建了绝佳的互动平台。在这些场合，不妨策划些趣味环节来促进非正式交流——比如设计\"人际宾果\"游戏让参与者互问问题赢取抽奖机会，或是组织城市漫游、桌游之夜等。全年持续的趣味活动能培育真诚的人际关系，这也有助于消除人们对参与贡献的恐惧心理。 欲了解更多关于开源社区指导关系的思路，请参阅本指南中关于构建指导者文化的章节。","breadcrumbs":"吸引用户

年代开始的研究逐渐聚焦于内在动机——这种动机除了活动本身外无需明显回报。爱德华·德西和理查德·瑞安提出的自我决定理论，正是源于对内在与外在动机的比较研究，以及人们日益认识到内在动机在行为中的主导作用。 谈及开源软件，人们首先想到的或许是意识形态或利他主义的动机。毕竟，就自由软件而言，即便用户获取源代码存在实际利益，但从诞生之初就始终带有意识形态和政治色彩。 有调查证据显示，这些因素能在一定程度上激励贡献者。然而研究结果并不一致。部分贡献者在调查中表示，他们参与开源的部分原因是出于意识形态或利他主义动机。但这种效应在将开源视为业余爱好的贡献者中最为显著。虽然利他主义确实可能影响职业贡献者，但这种情况主要出现在那些对薪资及其他职业发展方面已感到满意的贡献者群体中。 利他主义的一种变体是亲缘友善。它与馈赠经济的概念相关，但特指不期待精确 互惠 的家庭（亲属）群体。（换句话说，家庭成员互相付出，但通常不会——至少不会系统地——持续记录谁最近没有尽责。）它与利他主义的区别在于，这种友善仅限于个人所属的群体，比如开源社区。同样，相关研究结果不一。研究普遍发现，明确的亲缘友善感与各种努力指标（如每周工作小时数）之间存在正向关联——但这种相关性往往相当微弱。 最后一点就是乐趣本身。这对经常接触开源开发者、设计师和内容创作者的人来说并不意外。他们中的大多数人都 喜欢 参与开源项目。2007 年一项大型研究（Luthiger and Jungwirth）指出，乐趣占据了项目投入时间中的 28%。不过话说回来，当开源只是业余爱好或你在职业上已获得满足时，由乐趣和利他主义驱动的动力自然更容易产生。","breadcrumbs":"指导参与者 »

内在动机","id":"81","title":"内在动机"},"82":{"body":"当今心理学文献也包含了内化的外在动机这一概念。这些外在动机，如获取技能以增强职业机会——但它们已被内化，使得动机源于内心，而非他人直接以“胡萝卜”（奖励）诱惑的结果。这其中的区别在于：学习一门新语言是因为你知道紧跟新技术终将带来回报，与直接因获得认证而加薪不同。在开源工作中，获得同行及潜在雇主中的良好声誉，便是这类动机在开源开发中发挥作用的一个绝佳例证。多项研究均支持同行声誉是参与动力的观点。 学习也常被视为参与开源项目的一大益处。学习本身能带来内在满足感，同时也是职业发展的重要推动力。不过在此很难将内在动机与外在动机完全区分开来——究竟是为学习而学习？还是为掌握工作所需的特定技能而学习？ 这一类别中的最后一个动机因素，是研究者所称的\"自用价值\"，但更通俗易懂的说法是\"挠自己的痒处\"。开发你自己想要的东西，并在此过程中为他人创造价值。这种价值最终会成为你自身的外在回报，但没有人强迫你去做。","breadcrumbs":"指导参与者 » 人们为什么参与开源社区 » 内化的外在动机","id":"82","title":"内化的外在动机"},"83":{"body":"正如前文所述，许多行为的动机都是多元化的，开源软件的贡献也不例外。不过这里有三个要点或许对你有所帮助。 不要指望非外在激励因素能承担过多作用。 确实有许多人是出于理想主义或利他精神为开源项目做贡献，但这些通常并非唯一动机，甚至可能不是主要因素。尤其对于那些有商业支持的项目而言，薪酬和其他职业发展福利往往非常重要。 要大力强化学习机会和同行认可等非外在激励因素。 虽然这些无法替代更直接的收益，但获得同行认可和接触新技术领域的机会也是重要动力。组织应考虑建立同行认可机制，并明确鼓励学习，以充分利用这些激励因素。 过度强调激励因素可能适得其反。 正因为动机具有多面性，所以不要过度依赖任何一种单一动机。我们已经讨论过意识形态和利他主义的局限性。但也要考虑像\"解决自身需求\"这样的动机。如果这是某人贡献的唯一理由，他们往往会根据自己的具体需求随意进出项目。这可能是一个完全可以接受的结果，但这并不是培养长期维护者的途径。","breadcrumbs":"指导参与者 » 人们为什么参与开源社区 » 结论","id":"83","title":"结论"},"84":{"body":"前一章探讨了参与者加入开源项目并为之贡献的动机。促使人们参与开源项目的动机多种多样：有些是外在的（如承诺对其贡献给予金钱回报）；有些则是内在的（如出于利他主义愿望，想要为社区开发的软件贡献力量）。无论这些动机的本质如何，社区管理者和架构师都需要理解它们——因为只有理解了这些动机，他们才能更好地设计项目和社区，让现有和未来的参与者获得更多回报，同时更有效地鼓励他们最希望看到的贡献形式。本章我们将讨论各种模式和机制，用于鼓励、激励和奖励那些对蓬勃发展的开源项目及社区最有帮助的行为。","breadcrumbs":"指导参与者

但并非所有人参与开源项目的动机都相同。例如，近期 关于开源贡献动机的研究 表明，利他主义与寻求归属感对贡献者的激励作用，较十年前更为显著。此外，参与者表示他们持续贡献项目的动机往往与最初加入时的动机并不一致。某人可能因雇主希望将补丁推向上游而加入项目，但在将项目参与者视为同行群体并与成员建立归属感后选择留下。构建开源社区需要针对贡献者不断变化的参与动机，提供能让他们获得价值的新活动与机会，从而激励其持续贡献。 并非每位开源项目贡献者都会对项目投入深厚感情。你未必总能将偶尔参与的临时贡献者转化为持续稳定的重复贡献者——这也不应成为你的目标。更重要的是理解参与者的贡献如何契合或反映其贡献动机，并据此作出响应。正如 研究员Ann Barcomb所言 ：\"为充实简历或修复恼人漏洞而贡献的人，一旦需求得到满足，往往不会持续参与。\"但另一方面，这些周期性贡献者（巴库姆称之为\"间歇性贡献者\"）通常寻求复杂度低、易于说明且能快速解决的问题——这类问题恰恰是长期贡献者希望他人接手，以便自己专注其他事务的。 因此，社区管理者不应致力于打造 自认为 能激励所有人加入项目并大量贡献的体验，而应着力理解参与者 自身 的贡献动机，进而设计能够激发并满足这些动机的项目体验——这（理论上）将带来更高的参与度。这一点至关重要，不仅因为它将社区成员及其需求置于首位，更因为它让拥有不同时间、资源、知识和技能的贡献者，能以适合自身的方式参与项目，并以与他人同等的方式获得成就感。","breadcrumbs":"指导参与者 » 激励和奖励参与者 » 关于激励和奖励","id":"85","title":"关于激励和奖励"},"86":{"body":"用于认可和表彰开源项目各类贡献的策略被称为该项目的\"激励模式\"。项目构建的激励模式越多元，就越能吸引贡献动机各异的参与者。正如前文所述，每个人参与项目的初衷各不相同，而最受欢迎的项目往往能让贡献者感受到——无论以何种形式——自己的付出获得了回报、认可与尊重。在贡献者心中培育这种感受，是树立项目\"回报丰厚、氛围友好\"声誉的绝佳方式。但务必谨记：社区的激励模式会强化其表彰的具体行为；当人们了解社区如何认可参与者时，就会效仿那些被公开表彰的行为方式。因此，社区管理者和架构师在制定及调整项目激励模式时，必须深思熟虑、谨慎行事。他们有意或无意奖励的行为，正是鼓励人们持续强化的行为范式。 在本章剩余部分，我们将概述开源项目当前采用的一些较流行的奖励模式。由于每种模式都旨在契合参与者为项目贡献的特定动机，我们将详细阐述不同模式最适用的场景。","breadcrumbs":"指导参与者 » 激励和奖励参与者 » 了解项目的奖励模式","id":"86","title":"了解项目的奖励模式"},"87":{"body":"部分开源社区采用积分系统和排行榜机制，让参与者能够追踪并公开展示其对项目的贡献历史。社区可能为希望促发的项目活动（如修复文档错别字、提交补丁、在论坛帮助新用户等）设定对应积分值，当成员完成这些活动时即可获得相应积分。用户可选择将累计积分显示在其项目主页或社交媒体资料中。 积分系统通过图表形式公开记录和展示贡献，通过可视化方式体现贡献大小来奖励参与者。部分社区将这种奖励模式进一步升级，推出项目\"贡献排行榜\"，列出累计积分最高的贡献者。例如，社区可能会维护\"顶级贡献者\"或\"本月最活跃贡献者\"名单，通过轻松愉快的竞争氛围激励项目参与度。实际上，某些代码共享与协作平台已将此类\"排行榜\"功能作为标准配置；以 GitHub 代码库为例，其 Insights 标签页就专门展示项目中最活跃的贡献者。 这种奖励模式有助于吸引那些渴望展示技术实力的贡献者（让他们能彰显自身贡献的深度与广度），甚至能记录他们在项目中的历程，以此构建公开履历。简而言之，这是帮助贡献者在社区中建立声誉的一种方式。对于维护者而言，该模式同样实用，可轻松识别并进一步调动项目中最活跃的贡献者。 然而，排行榜系统尤其可能 打击 参与者的积极性。。 社区数据专家Georg Link写道 ：\"对于喜欢竞争、热衷于参与计入排行榜分数的活动的贡献者来说，登上排行榜的渴望能激发更高的参与度。但那些以不计入评分的方式参与的贡献者，则完全无缘上榜，可能会因此感到气馁。\"林克解释说，排行榜系统只奖励项目维护者选择奖励的活动——这隐晦地表明了哪些类型的贡献被认为更有价值。而并非所有潜在贡献者都有时间、天赋或资源以这些特定方式做出贡献。\"因此，\"林克表示，\"排行榜可能加剧开源项目在营造友好包容环境方面所面临的问题，因为无论设计得多好，只有特定类型的贡献者才能获得奖励。\"","breadcrumbs":"指导参与者 » 激励和奖励参与者 » 积分系统和排行榜","id":"87","title":"积分系统和排行榜"},"88":{"body":"与积分系统和排行榜密切相关的是社区徽章系统。为了表彰参与者对开源项目的贡献，社区可能会创建独特的数字标记或\"徽章\"，当贡献者完成特定活动时即可获得（ Fedora项目 就是这种奖励模式的典型范例）。这些活动可能包括参加社区活动、参与社区选举投票、更新项目文档，或是帮助新成员解决问题。贡献者可以将这些徽章展示在个人项目资料页上，作为他们为项目持续作出多样化贡献的证明。 确实，当社区希望激励多样化的贡献时，这种奖励模式非常有用。与积分系统不同——后者可能因重复执行相同任务而奖励参与者——徽章系统通过每当人们尝试并完成此前未涉足的事项时授予独特标识，鼓励人们以多种不同方式为项目作出贡献。如此一来，该系统能促使贡献者协助项目的多个方面。因此，与积分系统和排行榜类似，在参与者似乎受到扩展社区声誉的愿望驱动时，徽章系统是一种有效的奖励模式。 然而，当徽章系统容易被操纵或\"钻空子\"时，可能会使社区参与工作复杂化。正如Matt Cantu Snell在 在近期相关研究 中指出的，徽章系统可能激励参与者只做出获取徽章所需的最低限度贡献。因此，徽章系统或许会促使贡献者更倾向于利己行为——\"只为获取徽章而努力，而非聚焦社区福祉\"。斯内尔建议明确记录徽章获取要求，并在实施新的社区徽章前必须经过审查（或\"孵化\"）阶段。","breadcrumbs":"指导参与者 » 激励和奖励参与者 »

恤\"）。这种奖励模式特别适用于那些通过参与项目、融入社区获得强烈身份认同的贡献者。收到能公开彰显其重要社群归属——或体现群体内地位的物品，往往会激励他们持续为项目作出贡献。 然而，这种奖励模式通常需要大量资源。向全球社区成员打包寄送品牌周边物品可能非常耗时。此外，品牌物料的制作与分发往往涉及巨额资金支出。","breadcrumbs":"指导参与者 » 激励和奖励参与者 »

由于这种奖励模式包含了获得关注的机会，当你知道参与者渴望提升个人声誉和扩大职业社交圈时，它就非常有用。该模式在吸引和留住多元化贡献者方面尤其有效。那些突出展示来自弱势群体贡献者的社区，为这些群体中潜在的新贡献者提供了一种在项目中\"看到自己\"的方式，从而更有信心加入其中。此外，当社区允许成员自行提名、投票并表彰同行时，他们强化了共同价值观并增强了社会纽带。因此实施这种奖励模式还能帮助你联系那些将社区参与视为与他人建立联系、感受群体归属感以及与目标产生共鸣途径的贡献者。 但需注意，选择表彰特定贡献者会传递出\"这些贡献者体现了社区最珍视的原则与行为规范，值得其他成员效仿\"的潜在信息。此外，采用这种奖励模式的社区可能被指责\"偏袒熟人\"或形成封闭文化。为缓解此类问题，建议社区制定并公开基本评选流程：可让成员通过撰写推荐信来提名同伴，阐述被提名者对项目产生的具体影响，或如何践行项目核心价值。该流程还应包含\"被提名者有权婉拒表彰\"的选项，为不愿公开受奖的成员保留选择空间。","breadcrumbs":"指导参与者

这种新获得的赋能感也可以引发社区的关键演变。例如，当 开放组织社区 成员接近 项目五周年

当你了解到社区成员参与项目是为了拓宽专业经验时，这种奖励模式非常适用。因项目地位提升而获得新头衔的贡献者，可以考虑将这些头衔列入简历及其他职业文件。他们还可以指引他人关注自己在项目中更具影响力的工作，以此展示个人能力。当你发现特定社区成员致力于深化对项目的影响力时，采用此模式同样有效。意识到持续工作可能带来项目内权限与责任的提升，能激励他们更稳定地作出贡献。
